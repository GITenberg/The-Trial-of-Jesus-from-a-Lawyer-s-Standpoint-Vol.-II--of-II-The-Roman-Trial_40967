<h2>PREFACE TO VOLUME TWO</h2>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_s-preface.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="S" title="S" class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">S</span>UFFICIENT was said concerning
the entire work in the preface
to volume one to warrant a
very brief preface to volume two.</p>

<p>The reader will notice that the
plan of treatment of the Roman
trial of Jesus is radically different
from that employed in the
Hebrew trial. There is no Record
of Fact in the second volume, for the reason that
the Record of Fact dealt with in the first volume is
common to the two trials. Again, there is no Brief
of the Roman trial and no systematic and exhaustive
treatment of Roman criminal law in the second volume,
corresponding with such a treatment of the Hebrew
trial, under Hebrew criminal law, in the first
volume. This is explained by the fact that the Sanhedrin
found Jesus guilty, while both Pilate and Herod
found Him not guilty. A proper consideration then
of the Hebrew trial became a matter of review on
appeal, requiring a Brief, containing a complete statement
of facts, an ample exposition of law, and sufficient
argument to show the existence of error in the judgment.
The nature of the verdicts pronounced by Pilate
and by Herod rendered these things unnecessary in
dealing with the Roman trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>In Part II of this volume, Græco-Roman Paganism
at the time of Christ has been treated. It is
evident that this part of the treatise has no legal connection
with the trial of Jesus. It was added simply
to give coloring and atmosphere to the painting of the
great tragedy. It will serve the further purpose, it is
believed, of furnishing a key to the motives of the leading
actors in the drama, by describing their social, religious,
and political environments. The strictly legal
features of a great criminal trial are rarely ever altogether
sufficient for a proper understanding of even
the judicial aspects of the case. The religious faith of
Pilate, the judge, is quite as important a factor in determining
the merits of the Roman trial, as is the religious
belief of Jesus, the prisoner. This contention
will be fully appreciated after a careful perusal of
Chapter VI of this volume.</p>

<p>Short biographical sketches of about forty members
of the Great Sanhedrin who tried Jesus have been given
under Appendix I at the end of this work. They were
originally written by MM. Lémann, two of the greatest
Hebrew scholars of France, and are doubtless authoritative
and correct. These sketches will familiarize
the reader with the names and characters of a majority
of the Hebrew judges of Jesus. And it may be added
that they are a very valuable addition to the general
work, since the character of the tribunal is an important
consideration in the trial of any case, civil or
criminal.</p>

<p>The apocryphal Acts of Pilate have been given
under Appendix II. But the author does not thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>vouch for their authenticity. They have been added
because of their very intimate connection with the trial
of Jesus; and for the further reason that, whether
authentic or not, quotations from them are to be found
everywhere in literature, sacred and secular, dealing
with this subject. The mystery of their origin, the
question of their genuineness, and the final disposition
that will be made of them, render the Acts of Pilate a
subject of surpassing interest to the student of ancient
documents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A TWOFOLD JURISDICTION</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_t-ch01.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="T" title="T"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE Hebrew trial of Jesus having
ended, the Roman trial began.
The twofold character of
the proceedings against the
Christ invested them with a solemn
majesty, an awful grandeur.
The two mightiest jurisdictions
of the earth assumed
cognizance of charges against
the Man of Galilee, the central figure of all history.
"His tomb," says Lamartine, "was the grave of the
Old World and the cradle of the New," and now upon
His life before He descended into the tomb, Rome, the
mother of laws, and Jerusalem, the destroyer of prophets,
sat in judgment.</p>

<p>The Sanhedrin, or Grand Council, which conducted
the Hebrew trial of Jesus was the high court of justice
and the supreme tribunal of the Jews. It numbered
seventy-one members. Its powers were legislative,
executive, and judicial. It exercised all the functions
of education, of government, and of religion. It was
the national parliament of the Hebrew Theocracy, the
human administrator of the divine will. It was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>most august tribunal that ever interpreted or administered
religion to man. Its judges applied the laws of
the most peculiar and venerable system of jurisprudence
known to civilized mankind, and condemned
upon the charge of blasphemy against Jehovah, the
most precious and illustrious of the human race.
Standing alone, the Hebrew trial of Christ would have
been the most thrilling and impressive judicial proceeding
in all history. The Mosaic Code, whose provisions
form the basis of this trial, is the foundation
of the Bible, the most potent juridical as well as spiritual
agency in the universe. In all the courts of
Christendom it binds the consciences, if it does not
mold the convictions, of judge and jury in passing
judgment upon the rights of life, liberty, and property.
The Bible is everywhere to be found. It is read in
the jungles of Africa, while crossing burning deserts,
and amidst Arctic snows. No ship ever puts to sea
without this sacred treasure. It is found in the cave
of the hermit, in the hut of the peasant, in the palace of
the king, and in the Vatican of the pope. It adorns
the altar where bride and bridegroom meet to pledge
eternal love. It sheds its hallowing influence upon the
baptismal font where infancy is christened into religious
life. Its divine precepts furnish elements of
morals and manliness in formative life to jubilant
youth; cast a radiant charm about the strength of lusty
manhood; and when life's pilgrimage is ended, offer
to the dying patriarch, who clasps it to his bosom, a
sublime solace as he crosses the great divide and passes
into the twilight's purple gloom. This noble book has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>furnished not only the most enduring laws and the sublimest
religious truths, but inspiration as well to the
grandest intellectual triumphs. It is literally woven
into the literature of the world, and few books of modern
times are worth reading that do not reflect the sentiments
of its sacred pages. And it was the Mosaic
Code, the basis of this book, that furnished the legal
guide to the Sanhedrin in the trial of the Christ.
Truly it may be said that no other trial mentioned in
history would have been comparable to this, if the proceedings
had ended here. But to the Hebrew was
added Roman cognizance, and the result was a judicial
transaction at once unique and sublime. If the sacred
spirit of the Hebrew law has illuminated the conscience
of the world in every age, it must not be forgotten
that "the written reason of the Roman law has
been silently and studiously transfused" into all our
modern legal and political life. The Roman judicial
system is incomparable in the history of jurisprudence.
Judea gave religion, Greece gave letters, and Rome
gave laws to mankind. Thus runs the judgment of the
world. A fine sense of justice was native to the Roman
mind. A spirit of domination was the mental accompaniment
of this trait. The mighty abstraction called
Rome may be easily resolved into two cardinal concrete
elements: the Legion and the Law. The legion
was the unit of the military system through which
Rome conquered the world. The law was the cementing
bond between the conquered states and the sovereign
city on the hills. The legion was the guardian
and protector of the physical boundaries of the Empire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>and Roman citizens felt contented and secure, as
long as the legionaries were loyal to the standards and
the eagles. The presence of barbarians at the gate
created not so much consternation and despair among
the citizens of Rome, as did the news of the mutiny of
the soldiers of Germanicus on the Rhine. What the
legion was to the body, the law was to the soul of Rome&mdash;the
highest expression of its sanctity and majesty.
And when her physical body that once extended from
Scotland to Judea, and from Dacia to Abyssinia was
dead, in the year 476 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, her soul rose triumphant in
her laws and established a second Roman Empire over
the minds and consciences of men. The Corpus Juris
Civilis of Justinian is a text-book in the greatest universities
of the world, and Roman law is to-day the
basis of the jurisprudence of nearly every state of continental
Europe. The Germans never submitted to
Cæsar and his legions. They were the first to resist
successfully, then to attack vigorously, and to overthrow
finally the Roman Empire. And yet, until a
few years ago, Germans obeyed implicitly the edicts
and decrees of Roman prætors and tribunes. Is it any
wonder, then, that the lawyers of all modern centuries
have looked back with filial love and veneration to the
mighty jurisconsults of the imperial republic? Is it any
wonder that the tragedy of the Prætorium and Golgotha,
aside from its sacred aspects, is the most notable
event in history? Jesus was arraigned in one day, in
one city, before the sovereign courts of the universe;
before the Sanhedrin, the supreme tribunal of a divinely
commissioned race; before the court of the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>Empire that determined the legal and political
rights of men throughout the known world. The
Nazarene stood charged with blasphemy and with
treason against the enthroned monarchs represented by
these courts; blasphemy against Jehovah who, from
the lightning-lit summit of Sinai, proclaimed His laws
to mankind; treason against Cæsar, enthroned and
uttering his will to the world amidst the pomp and
splendor of Rome. History records no other instance
of a trial conducted before the courts of both Heaven
and earth; the court of God and the court of man;
under the law of Israel and the law of Rome; before
Caiaphas and Pilate, as the representatives of these
courts and administrators of these laws.</p>

<p>Approaching more closely the consideration of the
nature and character of the Roman trial, we are confronted
at once by several pertinent and interesting
questions.</p>

<p>In the first place, were there two distinct trials of
Jesus? If so, why were there two trials instead of one?
Were the two trials separate and independent? If not,
was the second trial a mere review of the first, or was
the first a mere preliminary to the second?</p>

<p>Again, what charges were brought against Jesus at
the hearing before Pilate? Were these charges the
same as those preferred against Him at the trial before
the Sanhedrin? Upon what charge was He finally
condemned and crucified?</p>

<p>Again, what Roman law was applicable to the
charges made against Jesus to Pilate? Did Pilate
apply these laws either in letter or in spirit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>Was there an attempt by Pilate to attain substantial
justice, either with or without the due observance of
forms of law?</p>

<p>Did Pilate apply Hebrew or Roman law to the
charges presented to him against the Christ?</p>

<p>What forms of criminal procedure, if any, were employed
by Pilate in conducting the Roman trial of
Jesus? If not legally, was Pilate politically justified
in delivering Jesus to be crucified?</p>

<p>A satisfactory answer to several of these questions,
in the introductory chapters of this volume, is deemed
absolutely essential to a thorough understanding of the
discussion of the trial proper which will follow. The
plan proposed is to describe first the powers and duties
of Pilate as presiding judge at the trial of Christ.
And for this purpose, general principles of Roman
provincial administration will be outlined and discussed;
the legal and political status of the subject Jew
in his relationship to the conquering Roman will be
considered; and the exact requirements of criminal
procedure in Roman capital trials, at the time of
Christ, will, if possible, be determined. It is believed
that in the present case it will be more logical and
effective to state first what should have been done by
Pilate in the trial of Jesus, and then follow with an
account of what was actually done, than to reverse this
order of procedure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>NUMBER OF REGULAR TRIALS</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/cap_w-ch06.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="W" title="W"
class="floatl" />

<i><span class="hidden">W</span>ERE there two regular trials of
Jesus?</i> In the first volume of
this work this question was reviewed
at length in the introduction
to the Brief. The authorities
were there cited and
discussed. It was there seen
that one class of writers deny the
existence of the Great Sanhedrin
at the time of Christ. These same writers declare
that there could have been no Hebrew trial of Jesus,
since there was no competent Hebrew court in existence
to try Him. This class of critics assert that the
so-called Sanhedrin that met in the palace of Caiaphas
was an ecclesiastical body, acting without judicial
authority; and that their proceedings were merely
preparatory to charges to be presented to Pilate, who
was alone competent to try capital cases. Those who
make this contention seek to uphold it by saying that
the errors were so numerous and the proceedings so
flagrant, according to the Gospel account, that there
could have been no trial at all before the Sanhedrin;
that the party of priests who arrested and examined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>Jesus did not constitute a court, but rather a vigilance
committee.</p>

<p>On the other hand, other writers contend that the
only regular trial was that before the Sanhedrin; and
that the appearance before Pilate was merely for the
purpose of securing his confirmation of a regular judicial
sentence which had already been pronounced.
Renan, the ablest exponent of this class, says: "The
course which the priests had resolved to pursue in regard
to Jesus was quite in conformity with the established
law. The plan of the enemies of Jesus was to
convict Him, by the testimony of witnesses and by His
own avowals, of blasphemy and of outrage against the
Mosaic religion, to condemn Him to death according
to law, and then to get the condemnation sanctioned
by Pilate."</p>

<p>Still another class of writers contend that there were
two distinct trials. Innes thus tersely and forcibly
states the proposition: "Whether it was legitimate or
not for the Jews to condemn for a capital crime, on
this occasion they did so. Whether it was legitimate
or not for Pilate to try over again an accused whom
they had condemned, on this occasion he did so.
There were certainly two trials. And the dialogue
already narrated expresses with a most admirable
terseness the struggle which we should have expected
between the effort of the Jews to get a mere countersign
of their sentence, and the determination of Pilate
to assume the full judicial responsibility, whether of
first instance or of révision." This contention, it is believed,
is right, and has been acted upon in dividing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>the general treatise into two volumes, and in devoting
each to a separate trial of the case.</p>

<p>Why were there two trials of Jesus? When the Sanhedrists
had condemned Christ to death upon the
charge of blasphemy, why did they not lead Him away
to execution, and stone Him to death, as their law required?
Why did they seek the aid of Pilate and
invoke the sanction of Roman authority? The answer
to these questions is to be found in the historic relationship
that existed, at the time of the crucifixion, between
the sovereign Roman Empire and the dependent
province of Judea. The student of history will remember
that the legions of Pompey overran Palestine
in the year 63 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and that the land of the Jews then
became a subject state. After the deposition of Archelaus,
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 6, Judea became a Roman province, and was
governed by procurators who were sent out from
Rome. The historian Rawlinson has described the
political situation of Judea, at the time of Christ, as
"complicated and anomalous, undergoing frequent
changes, but retaining through them all certain peculiarities
which made that country unique among the
dependencies of Rome. Having passed under Roman
rule with the consent and by the assistance of a large
party of its inhabitants, it was allowed to maintain for
a while a sort of semi-independence. A mixture of
Roman with native power resulted from this cause and
a complication in a political status difficult to be thoroughly
understood by one not native and contemporary."</p>

<p>The difficulty in determining the exact political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>status of the Jews at the time of Christ has given birth
to the radically different views concerning the number
and nature of the trials of Jesus. The most learned
critics are in direct antagonism on the point. More
than forty years ago Salvador and Dupin debated the
question in France. The former contended that the
Sanhedrin retained complete authority after the Roman
conquest to try even capital crimes, and that sentence
of death pronounced by the supreme tribunal of
the Jews required only the countersign or approval of
the Roman procurator. On the other hand, it was
argued by Dupin that the Sanhedrin had no right
whatever to try cases of a capital nature; that their
whole procedure was a usurpation; and that the only
competent and legitimate trial of Christ was the one
conducted by Pilate. How difficult the problem is of
solution will be apparent when we reflect that both
these disputants were able, learned, conscientious men
who, with the facts of history in front of them, arrived
at entirely different conclusions. Amidst the general
confusion and uncertainty, the reader must rely upon
himself, and appeal to the facts and philosophy of history
for light and guidance.</p>

<p>In seeking to ascertain the political relationship between
Rome and Judea at the time of Christ, two important
considerations should be kept in mind: (1)
That there was no treaty or concordat, defining mutual
rights and obligations, existing between the two powers;
Romans were the conquerors and Jews were the
conquered; the subject Jews enjoyed just so much
religious and political freedom as the conquering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>Romans saw fit to grant them; (2) that it was the
policy of the Roman government to grant to subject
states the greatest amount of freedom in local self-government
that was consistent with the interests and
sovereignty of the Roman people. These two considerations
are fundamental and indispensable in forming
a correct notion of the general relations between the
two powers.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of Judea as a fragment of the
mighty Roman Empire should also be kept clearly in
mind. Roman conquest, from first to last, resulted in
three distinct types of political communities more or
less strongly bound by ties of interest to Rome. These
classes were: (1) Free states; (2) allied states; and
(3) subject states. The communities of Italy were in
the main, free and allied, and were members of a great
military confederacy. The provinces beyond Italy
were, in the main, subject states and dependent upon
the good will and mercy of Rome. The free states received
from Rome a charter of privileges (<i>lex data</i>)
which, however, the Roman senate might at any time
revoke. The allied cities were bound by a sworn
treaty (<i>fædus</i>), a breach of which was a cause of war.
In either case, whether of charter or treaty, the grant
of privileges raised the state or people on whom it was
conferred to the level of the Italian communes and
secured to its inhabitants absolute control of their own
finances, free and full possession of their land, which
exempted them from the payment of tribute, and,
above all, allowed them entire freedom in the administration
of their local laws. The subject states were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>ruled by Roman governors who administered the so-called
law of the province (<i>lex provinciæ</i>). This law
was peculiar to each province and was framed to meet
all the exigencies of provincial life. It was sometimes
the work of a conquering general, assisted by a commission
of ten men appointed by the senate. At other
times, its character was determined by the decrees of
the emperor and the senate, as well as by the edicts
of the prætor and procurator. In any case, the law of
the province (<i>lex provinciæ</i>) was the sum total of the
local provincial law which Rome saw fit to allow the
people of the conquered state to retain, with Roman
decrees and regulations superadded. These added decrees
and regulations were always determined by local
provincial conditions. The Romans were no sticklers
for consistency and uniformity in provincial administration.
Adaptability and expediency were the main
traits of the lawgiving and government-imposing
genius of Rome. The payment of taxes and the furnishing
of auxiliary troops were the chief exactions imposed
upon conquered states. An enlightened public
policy prompted the Romans to grant to subject communities
the greatest amount of freedom consistent
with Roman sovereignty. Two main reasons formed
the basis of this policy. One was the economy of time
and labor, for the Roman official staff was not large
enough to successfully perform those official duties
which were usually incumbent upon the local courts.
Racial and religious differences alone would have impeded
and prevented a successful administration of
local government by Roman diplomats and officers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>Another reason for Roman noninterference in local
provincial affairs was that loyalty was created and
peace promoted among the provincials by the enjoyment
of their own laws and religions. To such an
extent was this policy carried by the Romans that it is
asserted by the best historians that there was little real
difference in practice between the rights exercised by
free and those enjoyed by subject states. On this point,
Mommsen says: "In regard to the extent of application,
the jurisdiction of the native courts and judicatories
among subject communities can scarcely have been
much more restricted than among the federated communities;
while in administration and in civil jurisdiction
we find the same principles operative as in legal
procedure and criminal laws."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The difference between
the rights enjoyed by subject and those exercised
by free states was that the former were subject to the
whims and caprices of Rome, while the latter were
protected by a written charter. A second difference
was that Roman citizens residing within the boundaries
of subject states had their own law and their own
judicatories. The general result was that the citizens
of subject states were left free to govern themselves
subject to the two great obligations of taxation and
military service. The Roman authorities, however,
could and did interfere in legislation and in administration
whenever Roman interests required.</p>

<p>Now, in the light of the facts and principles just
stated, what was the exact political status of the Jews
at the time of Christ? Judea was a subject state. Did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>the general laws of Roman provincial administration
apply to this province? Or were peculiar rights and
privileges granted to the strange people who inhabited
it? A great German writer answers in the affirmative.
Geib says: "Only one province ... namely Judea, at
least in the earlier days of the empire, formed an exception
to all the arrangements hitherto described.
Whereas in the other provinces the whole criminal
jurisdiction was in the hands of the governor, and only
in the most important cases had the supreme imperial
courts to decide&mdash;just as in the least important matters
the municipal courts did&mdash;the principle that applied
in Judea was that at least in regard to questions of religious
offenses the high priest with the Sanhedrin
could pronounce even death sentences, for the carrying
out of which, however, the confirmation of the procurator
was required."</p>

<p>That Roman conquest did not blot out Jewish local
self-government; and that the Great Sanhedrin still
retained judicial and administrative power, subject to
Roman authority in all matters pertaining to the local
affairs of the Jews, is thus clearly and pointedly stated
by Schürer: "As regards the area over which the
jurisdiction of the supreme Sanhedrin extended, it has
been already remarked above that its <i>civil</i> authority
was restricted, in the time of Christ, to the eleven
toparchies of Judea proper. And accordingly, for this
reason, it had no judicial authority over Jesus Christ
so long as He remained in Galilee. It was only as
soon as He entered Judea that He came directly under
its jurisdiction. In a certain sense, no doubt, the Sanhedrin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>exercised such jurisdiction over <i>every</i> Jewish
community in the world, and in that sense over Galilee
as well. Its orders were regarded as binding throughout
the entire domain of orthodox Judaism. It had
power, for example, to issue warrants to the congregations
(synagogues) in Damascus for the apprehension
of the Christians in that quarter (Acts ix. 2; xxii. 5;
xxvi. 12). At the same time, however, the extent to
which the Jewish communities were willing to yield
obedience to the orders of the Sanhedrin always depended
on how far they were favorably disposed
toward it. It was only within the limits of Judea
proper that it exercised any direct authority. There
could not possibly be a more erroneous way of defining
the extent of its jurisdiction as regards the kind of
causes with which it was competent to deal than to say
that it was the <i>spiritual or theological</i> tribunal in contradistinction
to the civil judicatories of the Romans.
On the contrary, it would be more correct to say that
it formed, in contrast to the foreign authority of Rome,
that <i>supreme native</i> court which here, as almost
everywhere else, the Romans had allowed to continue
as before, only imposing certain restrictions with regard
to competency. To this tribunal then belonged
all those judicial matters and all those measures of an
administrative character which either could not be
competently dealt with by the inferior or local courts
or which the Roman procurator had not specially
reserved for himself."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The closing words of the last quotation suggest an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>important fact which furnishes the answer to the question
asked at the beginning of this chapter, Why were
there two trials of Jesus? Schürer declares that the
Sanhedrin retained judicial and administrative power
in all local matters which the "procurator had not
specially reserved for himself." Now, it should be
borne in mind that there is not now in existence and
that there probably never existed any law, treaty or
decree declaring what judicial acts the Sanhedrin was
competent to perform and what acts were reserved to
the authority of the Roman governor. It is probable
that in all ordinary crimes the Jews were allowed a
free hand and final decision by the Romans. No interference
took place unless Roman interests were involved
or Roman sovereignty threatened. But one
fact is well established by the great weight of authority:
that the question of sovereignty was raised whenever
the question of life and death arose; and that
Rome reserved to herself, in such a case, the prerogative
of final judicial determination. Even this contention,
however, has been opposed by both ancient and
modern writers of repute; and, for this reason, it has
been thought necessary to cite authorities and offer arguments
in favor of the proposition that the right of
life or death, <i>jus vitæ aut necis</i>, had passed from Jewish
into Roman hands at the time of Christ. Both
sacred and profane history support the affirmative of
this proposition. Regarding this matter, Schürer
says: "There is a special interest attaching to the question
as to how far the jurisdiction of the Sanhedrin
was limited by the authority of the Roman procurator.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>We accordingly proceed to observe that, inasmuch as
the Roman system of provincial government was not
strictly carried out in the case of Judea, as the simple
fact of its being administered by means of a procurator
plainly shows, the Sanhedrin was still left in the enjoyment
of a comparatively high degree of independence.
Not only did it exercise civil jurisdiction, and that
according to Jewish law (which was only a matter of
course, as otherwise a Jewish court of justice would
have been simply inconceivable), but it also enjoyed a
considerable amount of criminal jurisdiction as well.
It had an independent authority in regard to political
affairs, and consequently possessed the right of ordering
arrests to be made by its own officers (Matt. xxvi.
47; Mark xiv. 43; Acts iv. 3; v. 17, 18). It had also
the power of finally disposing, on its own authority,
of such cases as did not involve sentence of death (Acts
iv. 5-23; v. 21-40). It was only in cases in which such
sentence of death was pronounced that the judgment
required to be ratified by the authority of the procurator."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Jews contend, and, indeed, the Talmud states
that "forty years before the destruction of the temple
the judgment of capital cases was taken away from
Israel."</p>

<p>Again, we learn from Josephus that the Jews had
lost the power to inflict capital punishment from the
day of the deposition of Archelaus, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 6, when Judea
became a Roman province and was placed under the
control of Roman procurators. The great Jewish historian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>says: "And now Archelaus's part of Judea was
reduced into a province, and Coponius, one of the
equestrian order among the Romans, was sent as procurator,
having the power of life and death put into
his hands by Cæsar."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Again, we are informed that Annas was deposed
from the high priesthood by the procurator Valerius
Gratus, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 14, for imposing and executing capital
sentences. One of his sons, we learn from Josephus,
was also deposed by King Agrippa for condemning
James, the brother of Jesus, and several others, to death
by stoning. At the same time, Agrippa reminded the
high priest that the Sanhedrin could not lawfully assemble
without the consent of the procurator.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>That the Jews had lost and that the Roman procurators
possessed the power over life and death is also
clearly indicated by the New Testament account of the
trial of Jesus. One passage explicitly states that Pilate
claimed the right to impose and carry out capital sentences.
Addressing Jesus, Pilate said: "Knowest thou
not that I have power to crucify thee and have power
to release thee?"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In another passage, the Jews admitted that the
power of life and death had passed away from them.
Answering a question of Pilate, at the time of the trial,
they answered: "It is not lawful for us to put any man
to death."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>If we keep in mind the fact stated by Geib that "the
principle that applied in Judea was that at least in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>regard to questions of religious offense the high priest
with the Sanhedrin could pronounce even death sentences,
for the carrying out of which, however, the
confirmation of the procurator was required," we are
then in a position to answer finally and definitely the
question, Why were there two trials of Jesus?</p>

<p>In the light of all the authorities cited and discussed
in this chapter, we feel justified in asserting that the
Sanhedrin was competent to take the initiative in the
arrest and trial of Jesus on the charge of blasphemy,
this being a religious offense of the most awful gravity;
that this court was competent not only to try but
to pass sentence of death upon the Christ; but that its
proceedings had to be retried or at least reviewed
before the sentence could be executed. Thus two trials
were necessary. The Hebrew trial was necessary, because
a religious offense was involved with which
Rome refused to meddle, and of which she refused to
take cognizance in the first instance. The Roman trial
was necessary, because, instead of an acquittal which
would have rendered Roman interference unnecessary,
a conviction involving the death sentence had to be
reviewed in the name of Roman sovereignty.</p>

<p>Having decided that there were two trials, we are
now ready to consider the questions: Were the two
trials separate and independent? If not, was the second
trial a mere review of the first, or was the first a
mere preliminary to the second? No more difficult
questions are suggested by the trial of Jesus. It is, in
fact, impossible to answer them with certainty and
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>A possible solution is to be found in the nature of
the charge preferred against Jesus. It is reasonable
to suppose that in the conflict of jurisdiction between
Jewish and Roman authority the character of the crime
would be a determining factor. In the case of ordinary
offenses it is probable that neither Jews nor Romans
were particular about the question of jurisdiction. It
is more than probable that the Roman governor would
assert his right to try the case <i>de novo</i>, where the offense
charged either directly or remotely involved the
safety and sovereignty of the Roman state. It is entirely
reasonable to suppose that the Jews would insist
on a final determination by themselves of the merits of
all offenses of a religious nature; and that they would
insist that the Roman governor should limit his action
to a mere countersign of their decree. It is believed
that ordinarily these principles would apply. But the
trial of Jesus presents a peculiar feature which makes
the case entirely exceptional. And this peculiarity, it
is felt, contains a correct answer to the questions asked
above. Jesus was tried before the Sanhedrin on the
charge of blasphemy. This was a religious offense of
the most serious nature. But when the Christ was led
before Pilate, this charge was abandoned and that of
high treason against Rome was substituted. Now, it
is certain that a Roman governor would not have allowed
a Jewish tribunal to try an offense involving
high treason against Cæsar. This was a matter exclusively
under his control. It is thus certain that Pilate
did not merely review a sentence which had been
passed by the Sanhedrin after a regular trial, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>he tried <i>ab initio</i> a charge that had not been presented
before the Jewish tribunal at the night session in the
palace of Caiaphas.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that there were two trials of
Jesus; that these trials were separate and independent
as far as the charges, judges, and jurisdictions were
concerned; and that the only common elements were
the persons of the accusers and the accused.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>POWERS AND DUTIES OF PILATE</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_w-ch03.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt="W" title="W"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">W</span>HAT were the powers and duties
of Pilate as procurator of
Judea? What forms of criminal
procedure, if any, were employed
by him in conducting the
Roman trial of Jesus? This
chapter will be devoted to answering
these questions.</p>

<p>The New Testament Gospels
denominate Pilate the "governor" of Judea. A more
exact designation is contained in the Latin phrase,
<i>procurator Cæsaris</i>; the procurator of Cæsar. By this
is meant that Pilate was the deputy, attorney, or personal
representative of Tiberius Cæsar in the province
of Judea. The powers and duties of his office were by
no means limited to the financial functions of a Roman
quæstor, a <i>procurator fiscalis</i>. "He was a procurator
<i>cum potestate</i>; a governor with civil, criminal, and
military jurisdiction; subordinated no doubt in rank to
the adjacent governor of Syria, but directly responsible
to his great master at Rome."</p>

<p>A clear conception of the official character of Pilate
is impossible unless we first thoroughly understand the
official character of the man whose political substitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>he was. A thorough understanding of the official
character of Tiberius Cæsar is impossible unless we
first fully comprehend the political changes wrought
by the civil wars of Rome in which Julius Cæsar defeated
Cneius Pompey at the battle of Pharsalia and
made himself dictator and undisputed master of the
Roman world. With the ascendency of Cæsar the ancient
republic became extinct. But liberty was still
cherished in the hearts of Romans, and the title of king
was detestable. The hardy virtues and democratic
simplicity of the early republic were still remembered;
and patriots like Cicero had dreamed of the
restoration of the ancient order of things. But Roman
conquest was complete, Roman manners were corrupt,
and Roman patriotism was paralyzed. The hand of a
dictator guided by a single intelligence was the natural
result of the progressive degradation of the Roman
state. The logical and inevitable outcome of the death
of Cæsar and the dissolution of the Triumvirate was
the régime of Augustus, a monarchy veiled under republican
forms. Recognizing Roman horror of absolutism,
Roman love of liberty, and Roman detestation
of kingly power, Augustus, while in fact an emperor,
claimed to be only a plain Roman citizen intrusted
with general powers of government. He affected to
despise public honors, disclaimed every idea of personal
superiority, and exhibited extreme simplicity of
manners in public and private life. This was the
strategy of a successful politician who sought to conceal
offensive reality under the cloak of a pleasant deception.
Great Cæsar fallen at the foot of Pompey's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>statue was a solemn reminder to Augustus that the
dagger of the assassin was still ready to defend the
memory of freedom, after liberty was, in reality, dead.
And the refusal by the greatest of the Romans, at the
feast of the Lupercal, to accept a kingly crown when
it was thrice offered him by Antony, was a model of
discreet behavior and political caution for the first and
most illustrious of the emperors. In short, Augustus
dared not destroy the laws or assault the constitution of
the state. But he accomplished his object, nevertheless.
"He gathered into his own hands the whole honors
and privileges, which the state had for centuries
distributed among its great magistrates and representatives.
He became perpetual Princeps Senatus, or
leader of the legislative house. He became perpetual
Pontifex Maximus, or chief of the national religion.
He became perpetual Tribune, or guardian of the people,
with his person thereby made sacred and inviolable.
He became perpetual Consul, or supreme magistrate
over the whole Roman world, with the control
of its revenues, the disposal of its armies, and the
execution of its laws. And lastly he became perpetual
Imperator, or military chief, to whom every legionary
throughout the world took the <i>sacramentum</i>, and
whose sword swept the globe from Gibraltar to the
Indus and the Baltic. And yet in all he was a simple
citizen&mdash;a mere magistrate of the Republic. Only in
this one man was now visibly accumulated and concentrated
all that for centuries had broadened and expanded
under the magnificent abstraction of Rome."
The boundless authority of Rome was thus centered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>in the hands of a single person. Consuls, tribunes,
prætors, proconsuls, and procurators were merely the
agents and representatives of this person.</p>

<p>Tiberius Cæsar, the political master of Pontius Pilate,
was the successor of Augustus and the first inheritor
of his constitution. Under this constitution,
Augustus had divided the provinces into two classes.
The centrally located and peacefully disposed were
governed by proconsuls appointed by the senate. The
more distant and turbulent were subjected by Augustus
to his personal control, and were governed by procurators
who acted as his deputies or personal representatives.
Judea came in his second class, and the real
governor of his province was the emperor himself.
Tiberius Cæsar was thus the real procurator of Judea
at the time of the crucifixion and Pilate was his political
substitute who did his bidding and obeyed his will.
Whatever Tiberius might have done, Pilate might
have done. We are thus enabled to judge the extent
of Pilate's powers; powers clothed with <i>imperium</i> and
revocable only by the great procurator at Rome.</p>

<p>In the government of the purely subject states of a
province, the procurator exercised the unlimited jurisdiction
of the military <i>imperium</i>. No law abridged
the single and sovereign exercise of his will. Custom,
however, having in fact the force of law, prescribed
that he should summon to his aid a council of advisers.
This advisory body was composed of two elements:
(1) Roman citizens resident in this particular locality
where the governor was holding court; and (2) members
of his personal staff known as the Prætorian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>Cohort. The governor, in his conduct of judicial proceedings,
might solicit the opinions of the members of
his council. He might require them to vote upon the
question at issue; and might, if he pleased, abide by
the decision of the majority. But no rule of law required
him to do it; it was merely a concession and a
courtesy; it was not a legal duty.</p>

<p>Again, when it is said that the procurator exercised
the "unlimited jurisdiction of the military <i>imperium</i>,"
we must interpret this, paradoxical though it may
seem, in a restricted sense; that is, we must recognize
the existence of exceptions to the rule. It is unreasonable
to suppose that Rome, the mother of laws, ever
contemplated the rule of despotism and caprice in the
administration of justice in any part of the empire. It
is true that the effect of the <i>imperium</i>, "as applied to
provincial governorship, was to make each <i>imperator</i>
a king in his own domain"; but kings themselves have
nearly always been subject to restrictions; and the
authorities are agreed that the <i>imperium</i> of the Roman
procurator of the time of Christ was hemmed in by
many limitations. A few of these may be named.</p>

<p>In the first place, the rights guaranteed to subject
states within the provincial area by the law of the
province (<i>lex provinciæ</i>) were the first limitations
upon his power.</p>

<p>Again, it is a well-known fact that Roman citizens
could appeal from the decision of the governor, in certain
cases, to the emperor at Rome. Paul exercised
this right, because he was a Roman citizen.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Jesus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>could not appeal from the judgment of Pilate, because
He was not a Roman citizen.</p>

<p>Again, fear of an aroused and indignant public sentiment
which might result in his removal by the emperor,
exercised a salutary restraint upon the conduct,
if it did not abridge the powers of the governor.</p>

<p>These various considerations bring us now to the
second question asked in the beginning of this chapter:
What forms of criminal procedure, if any, were employed
by Pilate in conducting the Roman trial of
Jesus?</p>

<p>It is historically true that Pilate exercised, as procurator
of Judea, the unlimited jurisdiction of the military
<i>imperium</i>; and that this <i>imperium</i> made him virtually
an "<i>imperator</i>, a king in his own domain." It
is also historically true that the inhabitants of the
purely subject states of a province, who were not themselves
Roman citizens, when accused of crime, stood
before a Roman governor with no protection except
the plea of justice against the summary exercise of
absolute power. In other words, in the employment
of the unlimited jurisdiction of the military <i>imperium</i>,
a Roman governor, in the exercise of his discretion,
might, in the case of non-Roman citizens of a subject
state, throw all rules and forms of law to the wind,
and decide the matter arbitrarily and despotically. It
may be that Pilate did this in this case. But the best
writers are agreed that this was not the policy of the
Roman governors in the administration of justice in
the provinces at the time of Christ. The lawgiving
genius of Rome had then reached maturity and approximate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>perfection in the organization of its criminal
tribunals. It is not probable, as before suggested,
that despotism and caprice would be systematically tolerated
anywhere in the Roman world. If the emperors
at Rome were forced, out of regard for public
sentiment, to respect the constitution and the laws, it is
reasonable to infer that their personal representatives
in the provinces were under the same restraint. We
feel justified then in asserting that Pilate, in the trial
of Jesus, should have applied certain laws and been
governed by certain definite rules of criminal procedure.
What were these rules? A few preliminary
considerations will greatly aid the reader in arriving
at an answer to this question. It should be understood:</p>

<p>(1) That Pilate was empowered to apply either Roman
law or the local law in the trial of any case where
the crime was an offense against both the province and
the empire, as in the crime of murder; but that in the
case of treason with which Jesus was charged he would
apply the law of Rome under forms of Roman procedure.
It has been denied that Pilate had a right to
apply Jewish law in the government of his province;
but this denial is contrary to authority. Innes says:
"The Roman governor sanctioned, or even himself administered,
the old law of the region."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Schürer says:
"It may be assumed that the administration of the
civil law was wholly in the hands of the Sanhedrin
and native or local magistrates: Jewish courts decided
according to Jewish law. But even in the criminal law
this was almost invariably the case, only with this exception,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>that death sentences required to be confirmed
by the Roman procurator. In such cases, the procurator
decided, if he pleased, according to Jewish law."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Greenidge says: "Even the first clause of the Sicilian
<i>lex</i>, if it contained no reference to jurisdiction by the
local magistrate, left the interpretation of the <i>native
law</i> wholly to Roman <i>proprætors</i>."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is thus clearly
evident that Roman procurators might apply either
Roman or local laws in ordinary cases.</p>

<p>(2) That Roman governors were empowered to
apply the adjective law of Rome to the substantive law
of the province. In support of this contention, Greenidge
says: "The edict of the <i>proprætor</i> or pro-consul,
... clearly could not express the native law of each
particular state under its jurisdiction; but its generality
and its expansiveness admitted, as we shall see, of
an application of Roman forms to the substantive law
of any particular city."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>(3) That the criminal procedure employed by Pilate
in the trial of Jesus should have been the criminal
procedure of a capital case tried at Rome, during the
reign of Tiberius Cæsar. This fact is very evident
from the authorities. The trial of capital cases at
Rome furnished models for similar trials in the provinces.
In the exercise of the unlimited jurisdiction of
the military <i>imperium</i>, Roman governors might disregard
these models. But, ordinarily, custom compelled
them to follow the criminal precedents of the Capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>of the empire. The following authorities support this
contention.</p>

<p>Rosadi says: "It is also certain that in the provinces
the same order was observed in criminal cases as was
observed in cases tried at Rome."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This eminent Italian
writer cites, in proof of this statement, Pothier,
Pandect. XLVIII. 2, n. 28.</p>

<p>Greenidge says: "Yet, in spite of this absence of
legal checks, the criminal procedure of the provinces
was, in the protection of the citizen as in other respects,
closely modelled on that of Rome."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>To the same effect, but more clearly and pointedly
expressed, is Geib, who says: "It is nevertheless true
that the knowledge which we have, imperfect though
it may be, leaves no doubt that the courts of the Italian
municipalities and provinces had, in all essential elements,
the permanent tribunals (<i>quæstiones perpetuæ</i>)
as models; so that, in fact, a description of the proceedings
in the permanent tribunals is, at the same
time, to be regarded as a description of the proceedings
in the provincial courts."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>These permanent tribunals (<i>quæstiones perpetuæ</i>)
were courts of criminal jurisdiction established at
Rome, and were in existence at the time of the crucifixion.
Proceedings in these courts in capital cases,
were models of criminal procedure in the provinces at
the time of Christ. It logically follows then that if we
can ascertain the successive steps in the trial of a capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>case at Rome before one of the permanent tribunals,
we have accurate information of the exact form of
criminal procedure, not that Pilate did employ, but
which he should have employed in the trial of Jesus.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the purposes of this treatise, every
step which Roman law required in the trial of capital
cases at Rome is as well known as the provisions of any
modern criminal code. From the celebrated Roman
trials in which Cicero appeared as an advocate, may
be gleaned with unerring accuracy the fullest information
touching all the details of capital trials at Rome at
the time of Cicero.</p>

<p>It should be observed, at this point, that the period
of Roman jurisprudence just referred to was in the
closing years of the republic; and that certain
changes in the organization of the tribunals as well as
in the forms of procedure were effected by the legislation
of Augustus. But we have it upon the authority
of Rosadi that these changes were not radical in the
case of the criminal courts and that the rules and regulations
that governed procedure in them during the
republic remained substantially unchanged under the
empire. The same writer tells us that the permanent
tribunals for the trial of capital cases did not go out of
existence until the third century of the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The following chapter will be devoted, in the main,
to a description of the mode of trial of capital cases at
Rome before the permanent tribunals at the time of
Christ.</p>

<hr class="l65" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MODE OF TRIAL IN ROMAN CAPITAL CASES</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_t-ch01.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="T" title="T"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE reader should keep clearly
and constantly in mind the purpose
of this chapter: to describe
the mode of trial in capital cases
at Rome during the reign of Tiberius
Cæsar; and thus to furnish
a model of criminal procedure
which Pilate should have
imitated in the trial of Jesus at
Jerusalem. In the last chapter, we saw that the proceedings
of the permanent tribunals (<i>quæstiones perpetuæ</i>)
at Rome furnished models for the trial of
criminal cases in the provinces. It is now only necessary
to determine what the procedure of the permanent
tribunals at the time of Christ was, in order to understand
what Pilate should have done in the trial of
Jesus. But the character of the <i>quæstiones perpetuæ</i>,
as well as the rules and regulations that governed their
proceedings, cannot well be understood without reference
to the criminal tribunals and modes of trial in
criminal cases that preceded them. Roman history
discloses two distinct periods of criminal procedure
before the organization of the permanent tribunals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>about the beginning of the last century of the Republic:
(1) The period of the kings and (2) the period of
the early republic. Each of these will be here briefly
considered.</p>

<p><i>The Regal Period.</i>&mdash;The earliest glimpses of Roman
political life reveal the existence of a sacred and military
monarchy in which the king is generalissimo of
the army, chief pontiff of the national religion, and
supreme judge in civil and criminal matters over the
lives and property of the citizens. These various powers
and attributes are wrapped up in the <i>imperium</i>.
By virtue of the <i>imperium</i>, the king issued commands
to the army and also exercised the highest judicial
functions over the lives and fortunes of his fellow-citizens.
The kings were thus military commanders
and judges in one person, as the consuls were after
them. The monarch might sit alone and judge cases
and impose sentences; but the trial was usually a personal
investigation undertaken by him with the advice
and aid of a chosen body of judges from the senate or
the pontifical college. According to Dionysius, Romulus
ordered that all crimes of a serious nature should
be tried by the king, but that all lighter offenses should
be judged by the senate.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Little confidence can be reposed
in this statement, since the age and deeds of
Romulus are exceedingly legendary and mythical.
But it is historically true that in the regal period of
Rome the kings were the supreme judges in all civil
and criminal matters.</p>

<p><i>The Early Republican Period.</i>&mdash;The abolition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>the monarchy and the establishment of the republic
witnessed the distribution of the powers of government
formerly exercised by the king among a number of
magistrates and public officers. Consuls, tribunes,
prætors, ædiles, both curule and plebeian, exercised,
under the republic, judicial functions in criminal
matters.</p>

<p>The consuls were supreme criminal judges at the
beginning of the republic, and were clothed with unlimited
power in matters of life and death. This is
shown by the condemnation and execution of the sons
of Brutus and their fellow-conspirators.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Associated
with the consuls were, at first, two annually appointed
quæstors whom they nominated. The functions of the
quæstors were as unlimited as those of their superiors,
the consuls; but their jurisdiction was confined chiefly
to criminal matters and finance.</p>

<p>The tribunes, sacred and inviolable in their persons
as representatives of the <i>plebs</i> and as their protectors
against patrician oppression, exercised at first merely
a negative control over the regular magistracies of the
community. But, finally, they became the chief public
prosecutors of political criminals.</p>

<p>The prætors, whose chief jurisdiction was in civil
matters, were potentially as fully criminal judges as
the consuls, and there may have been a time when a
portion of criminal jurisdiction was actually in their
hands. In the later republic, they presided over the
<i>quæstiones perpetuæ</i>, permanent criminal tribunals.</p>

<p>The ædiles are found in Roman history exercising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>functions of criminal jurisdiction, although their general
powers were confined to the special duties of caring
for the games, the market, and the archives.</p>

<p>But the criminal jurisdiction of the magistrates who
replaced the king at the downfall of the monarchy was
abridged and almost destroyed by the famous <i>lex
Valeria</i> (<i>de provocatione</i>). This law was proposed
509 <span class="small">B.C.</span> by Publius Valerius, one of the first consuls
of Rome, and provided that no magistrate should have
power to execute a sentence of death against a Roman
citizen who had appealed to the judgment of the people
in their public assembly. This <i>lex</i> was the <i>magna
charta</i> of the Romans and was justly regarded by them
as the great palladium of their civil liberty. And it
was this law that inaugurated the popular jurisdiction
of the <i>comitia</i>. The result was that for more than
three hundred years the final determination of the
question of life or death was in the hands of the people
themselves. From the passage of the Valerian law the
function of the magistrates was limited to the duty of
convincing the people of the guilt of an alleged criminal
against whom they themselves had already pronounced
a preliminary sentence. The magistrates
were, therefore, not so much judges as prosecutors;
the people were the final judges in the case.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Trial in the Comitia, or Public Assembly.</i>&mdash;On
a certain day, the prosecuting magistrate, who
had himself pronounced the preliminary sentence
against an accused person who had appealed to the
people in their public assembly, mounted the <i>rostra</i>,
and called the people together by the voice of a herald.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>He then made a proclamation that on a certain day
he would bring an accusation against a certain person
upon a given charge. At the same time, he called upon
this person to come forward and hear the charges
against him. The defendant then presented himself,
listened to the accusation, and immediately furnished
bond for his appearance, or in default of bail, was
thrown into prison. Upon the day announced at the
opening of the trial, the prosecuting magistrate again
mounted the <i>rostra</i>, and summoned the accused by a
herald, if he was at large, or had him brought forth if
he was in prison. The prosecutor then produced evidence,
oral and documentary, against the prisoner.
The indictment had to be in writing, and was published
on three market days in the Forum. The
prosecution came to an end on the third day, and the
accused then began his defense by mounting the <i>rostra</i>
with his patron and presenting evidence in his own
behalf. The prosecutor then announced that on a certain
day he would ask the people to render judgment
by their votes. In the early years of the republic, the
people voted by shouting their approval or disapproval
of the charges made; but later a tablet bearing
one of the two letters V. (<i>uti rogas</i>) or A. (<i>absolvo</i>)
was used as a ballot.</p>

<p>The effect of popular jurisdiction in criminal processes
at Rome was in the nature of a two-edged sword
that cut both ways. It was beneficial in the limitations
it imposed upon the conduct of single magistrates
who were too often capricious and despotic.
But this benefit was purchased at the price of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>kind of popular despotism not less dangerous in its
way. It has always been characteristic of popular
assemblies that their decisions have been more the outcome
of passion and prejudice than the result of calm
wisdom and absolute justice. The trouble at Rome
was that the people were both legislators and judges
in their public assemblies; and it nearly always happened
that the lawmakers rose above and trampled
upon the very laws which they themselves had made.
The natural offspring of this state of things is either
anarchy or despotism; and it was only the marvelous
vitality of the Roman Commonwealth that enabled it
to survive.</p>

<p>The reports of the great criminal trials before the
<i>comitia</i> reveal the inherent weakness of a system of
popular jurisdiction in criminal matters. Personal
and political considerations foreign to the merits of
the case were allowed to take the place of competent
evidence; and issues of right and expediency were too
frequently mixed up. The accused, at times, trusted
not so much in the righteousness of his cause as in the
feelings of compassion and prejudice that moved the
people as popular judges. And to excite these feelings
the most ludicrous and undignified steps were sometimes
taken. The defendant nearly always appeared
at the trial in mourning garb, frequently let his hair
and beard grow long, and often exhibited the scars
and wounds received in battle whilst fighting for his
country. He sometimes offered prayers to the immortal
gods and wept bitterly; at other times he caused
his children and other relatives to appear at the trial,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>wailing, and tearing their clothes. Not content with
presenting all the pathetic features of his own life, he
left nothing undone to expose his opponents to hatred
and contempt. It thus happened that many of the
great criminal causes of Rome were mere farcical proceedings.
A few instances may be cited.</p>

<p>Horatius, though tried in the time of the third
Roman king, was pardoned by the people for the murder
of his sister because of his heroic deed in single
combat with the three Curiatii, and because his father
had lost three children in the service of the state.</p>

<p>In the year 98, Manlius Aquillius, the pacificator of
Sicily, was tried for embezzlement. Marcus Antonius,
his advocate, ended his argument for the defense by
tearing the tunic of Aquillius to show the breast of the
veteran warrior covered with scars. The people were
moved to tears and Aquillius was acquitted, although
the evidence was very clear against him.</p>

<p>In the trial of M. Manlius, 384 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, new tactics
were employed. The accused refused to appear in
mourning. There was no weeping in his behalf. On
the other hand, Manlius relied upon his services to the
state for acquittal. He brought forward four hundred
citizens who by his generosity he had saved from bondage
for debt; he exhibited the spoils taken from thirty
slain enemies, also military decorations received for
bravery in battle&mdash;among them two mural and eight
civic crowns; he then produced many citizens rescued
by him from the hands of the enemy; he then bared
his breast and exhibited the scars received by him in
war; and, lastly, turning toward the Capitol, he implored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>Jupiter to protect him, and to infuse, at this
moment, into the Roman people, his judges, the same
spirit of courage and patriotism that had given him
strength to save the city of Rome and his whole country
from the hands of the Gauls. He begged the people
to keep their eyes fixed on the Capitol while they
were pronouncing sentence against him to whom they
owed life and liberty. It is said that his prosecutors
despaired of convicting him amidst such surroundings,
and adjourned the trial to another place, where the
Capitol could not be seen; and that thereupon the conviction
of Manlius was secured and his condemnation
pronounced.</p>

<p>In the year 185 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the tribune M. Nævius, at the
instigation of Cato, accused Scipio Africanus before
the tribes of having been bribed to secure a dishonorable
peace. It was clearly evident that a charge of this
kind could not well be sustained by evidence; but it
was believed that a conviction could be secured by an
appeal to the passion and prejudice of the multitude.
But this advantage operated as greatly in favor of
Scipio as it did in favor of his accusers. And he did
not fail to use the advantage to the fullest extent. In
seeming imitation of M. Manlius, two hundred years
before, he appealed for acquittal to the people on account
of his public services. He refused to appear in
mourning, offered no evidence in his own behalf,
nor did he exhibit the usual humility of an accused
Roman before his countrymen. With proud disdain,
he spurned the unworthy imputation of bribery, and
pointed the people to the magnificent achievements of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>his brilliant public career. He reminded them that the
day of the trial was itself the anniversary of his victory
over the greatest enemy that Rome ever had, at Zama.
It was degrading, he exclaimed, both to him and to
the Roman nation, to bring such a charge on this day
against the man to whom it was due that the Commonwealth
of Rome still existed. He refused to lower
himself, he said, by listening to the insolent charges of
a vulgar brawler who had never done anything for the
state. He declared that instead he would repair at
once to the temple of Jupiter and render thanks for his
victory over Hannibal to the protecting gods of his
country. With these words, he left the Forum and
went to the Capitol and from there to his house, accompanied
by the great majority of the people, while the
accusing tribune and his official staff were left alone in
the market place.</p>

<p>The inevitable result of these cases of miscarriage of
justice, in which patriotic bravado and rhetorical claptrap
took the place of legal rules, was a desire and demand
for the reform of criminal procedure. Besides,
it had ever been found troublesome and inconvenient
to summon the whole body of the Roman people to try
ordinary offenses. It was only in cases of great gravity
that the ponderous machinery of the <i>comitia centuriata</i>
could be set in motion. This difficulty was increased
with the growth of the republic, in which crimes also
grew in number and magnitude. The necessity for the
reform of the criminal law resulted in the institution
of permanent tribunals (<i>quæstiones perpetuæ</i>). A
series of legal enactments accomplished this result.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>The earliest law that created a permanent <i>quæstio</i> was
the <i>lex Calpurnia</i> of 149 <span class="small">B.C.</span> And it was the proceedings
in these courts, which we shall now describe, that
should have guided Pilate in the trial of Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Trial in the Permanent Tribunals.</i>&mdash;We
shall attempt to trace in the remaining pages of this
chapter the successive steps in the trial of criminal
cases before the permanent tribunals at Rome.</p>

<p><i>First Stage</i> (<i>postulatio</i>).&mdash;A Roman criminal trial
before a <i>quæstio perpetua</i> commenced with an application
to the presiding magistrate, the prætor or the
<i>iudex quæstionis</i>, for permission to bring a criminal
charge against a certain person. The technical Latin
expression for this request to prosecute is <i>postulatio</i>.
It should be here noted that State's attorneys or public
prosecutors, in a modern sense, were not known to the
Romans at this time. Private citizens took upon themselves
public prosecutions in behalf of the state. They
were encouraged to do this from motives of personal
profit as well as patriotic interest in the welfare of the
community. As young men in modern times, just admitted
to the bar, often accept criminal cases by assignment
from the court in order to make a beginning in
their professional careers, so young Roman nobles in
ancient times sought to make reputations for themselves
by accusing and prosecuting public delinquents.
And not only professional reputation, but financial
compensation as well could be gained in this way.
The Roman laws of the time of Cicero provided that
a successful prosecutor should receive one-fourth part
of the property confiscated or the fine imposed. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>Macedonian inscription offered a reward of 200
denarii to the prosecutor who should bring to justice
the desecrators of a tomb.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><i>Second Stage</i> (<i>divinatio</i>).&mdash;It often happened that
more than one accuser desired to prosecute a single
offense; but more than one prosecutor was not permitted
by Roman law unless there was more than one
crime charged. Then, in case of a concurrence of
would-be accusers, a preliminary trial was had to determine
which one of these was best fitted to bring the
accusation. This initial hearing was known in Roman
law as the <i>divinatio</i>. It was indeed more than a mere
hearing; it was a regular trial in which the question of
the fitness of the different candidates for the position of
<i>delator</i> was argued before the president and the jury.
This jury was in many cases distinct from the one that
finally tried the case on the merits. The purpose of
the whole proceeding known as the <i>divinatio</i> was to
secure a prosecutor who was at once both able and sincere;
and both these qualities were generally very
strenuously urged by all those who desired to assume
the rôle of accuser. Indeed all personal qualifications
involving the mental and moral attributes of the
would-be prosecutors were pointedly urged. At the
hearing, the different candidates frequently became
animated and even bitter opponents of each other.
Crimination and recrimination then followed as a
natural consequence. An applicant might show that
he was thoroughly familiar with the affairs of a
province, as a special fitness in the prosecution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>a public official for extortion in that province. An
opponent, on the other hand, might show that said
applicant had been associated with said official in
the government of the province and had been, and
was now, on the friendliest terms with him. After
the meritorious qualifications of all the claimants had
been presented, the president and jury rendered their
decision. The details of the evidence affecting the
merits of the charge were not considered at this preliminary
trial. Only such facts were considered as
affected the personal qualifications of the different candidates
for the place of accuser. When these qualifications
were about equally balanced in point of merit
between two applicants, the abler speaker was generally
chosen.</p>

<p><i>Third Stage</i> (<i>nominis delatio</i>).&mdash;It frequently happened
that the <i>postulatio</i>, the request to prosecute, was
not followed by the <i>divinatio</i>, the preliminary hearing
on the merits of different applicants, because there was
only one would-be accuser; and his qualifications were
beyond dispute. In such a case, when a request to
bring a criminal charge against a certain person had
been presented by a citizen to the prætor, there followed,
after a certain interval of time, a private hearing
before the president of the court for the purpose of
gaining fuller and more definite information concerning
the charge. This private proceeding was styled
the <i>nominis</i> or <i>criminis delatio</i>, and took place before
the president alone. Its main object was to secure a
specification of the personality of the accused as well
as of the charges brought against him. At this stage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>of the trial the presence of the accused person was
necessary, unless he was absent under valid excuse.
The <i>lex Memmia</i>, passed in the year 114 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, permitted
a delinquent to plead that he was absent from
Rome on public business, as an excuse for not appearing
at the <i>nominis delatio</i>. In the year 58 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the
tribune L. Antistius impeached Julius Cæsar. But the
colleagues of Antistius excused Cæsar from personal
attendance because he was absent in the service of the
state in Gaul. But, if the accused appeared at the
<i>nominis delatio</i>, the prosecutor interrogated him at
length concerning the facts of the crime. The purpose
of this interrogation (<i>interrogatio</i>) was to satisfy the
president that there was a prima facie case to carry
before the regular tribunal in open trial. The proceedings
of the <i>nominis delatio</i> were thus in the nature of
a modern Grand Jury investigation, instituted to determine
if a serious prosecution should be had.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Stage</i> (<i>inscriptio</i>).&mdash;If the interrogation
convinced the president that the prosecutor had a
prima facie case to take before the permanent tribunal,
he framed a form of indictment called the <i>inscriptio</i>.
This indictment was signed by the chief prosecutor
and also by a number of witnesses against the accused
called <i>subscriptores</i>. The charge was now definitely
fixed; and, from this moment, it was the only offense
that could be prosecuted at the trial. The drawing up
of this charge by the president was similar to the framing
of an indictment by a modern Grand Jury.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Stage</i> (<i>nominis receptio</i>).&mdash;After the indictment
or inscription had been framed, it was formally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>received by the president. This act was styled the
<i>nominis receptio</i> and corresponds, in a general way,
with the presentment of an indictment by a modern
Grand Jury. When the <i>nominis receptio</i> was complete,
the case was said to be <i>in judicio</i>, and the accused
was said to be <i>in reatu</i>. The president then fixed a day
certain for the appearance of the accused and the beginning
of the trial. The time fixed was usually ten
days from the <i>nominis receptio</i>. However, a longer
time was allowed if evidence had to be secured from
beyond the sea. Thirty days were allowed the accusers
in the prosecution of Scaurus. Cicero was given one
hundred and ten days to secure evidence against
Verres; but he actually employed only sixty. The
time granted the prosecutor was also required by the
law to be utilized by the defendant in preparing his
case.</p>

<p>The preliminary steps in the prosecution were now
complete, and the accused awaited the day of trial. In
the meantime, he was allowed to go at large, even
when charged with a grave offense like murder. Imprisonment
to prevent escape had almost ceased at the
time of which we write. If the evidence against the
accused was weak, it was felt that he would certainly
appear at the trial. If the evidence against him was
very strong, it was thought that he would seek to escape
a sentence of death in voluntary exile, a step
which Romans always encouraged, as they were
averse, at all times, to putting a Roman citizen to
death.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Stage</i> (<i>citatio</i>).&mdash;At the expiration of the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>designated by the president for the beginning of the
trial, the proceedings before the judges began. All the
necessary parties, including the judges or jurors, were
summoned by a herald to appear. This procedure was
termed the <i>citatio</i>. Strange to say, if the accused
failed to appear the case could proceed without him.
The reason for the requirement of his presence at the
<i>nominis delatio</i>, but not at the trial is not clear; especially
when viewed in the light of a modern trial in
which the defendant must be present at every important
step in the proceedings. Under Roman procedure,
the presence of the defendant was not necessary,
whether he was in voluntary exile, or was obstinately
absent. In 52 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, Milo was condemned in his absence;
and we read in Plutarch that the assassins of
Cæsar were tried in their absence, 43 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Excusable absence necessitated an adjournment of
the case. The chief grounds for an adjournment were:
(1) Absence from the city in the public service; (2)
that the accused was compelled to appear in another
court on the same day; (3) illness.</p>

<p>The absence of the accused did not prevent the
prosecution of the case, but the nonappearance of the
prosecutor on the day fixed for the beginning of
the trial usually terminated the proceedings at once.
The fact that the case had to be dismissed if the accuser
failed to appear only serves to illustrate how dependent
the state was on the sincerity of the citizen who undertook
the prosecution. The obligations of the prosecutor
honestly and vigorously to follow up a suit which
he had set in motion were felt to be so serious a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>by the Romans that special laws were passed to hold
him in the line of duty. The <i>lex Remmia</i> provided
that if any citizen knowingly accused another citizen
falsely of a crime, the accuser should be prosecuted
for calumny (<i>calumnia</i>). It further provided that,
in case of conviction, the letter K should be branded
on the forehead of the condemned. Such laws were
found necessary to protect the good name of Roman
citizens against bad men who desired to use the legal
machinery of the state to gratify private malevolence
against their enemies. It may thus be seen that the system
which permitted public prosecutions on the motion
of private citizens was attended by both good and
bad results. Cicero regarded such a system as a positive
benefit to the state.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Its undoubted effect was to
place a check upon corruption in public office by subjecting
the acts of public officials to the scrutiny and,
if need be, to the censure of every man in the nation.
On the other hand, accusers in public prosecutions
came finally to be identified, in the public mind, with
coarse and vulgar informers whose only motive in
making public accusations was to create private gain.
So thoroughly were they despised that one of the parasites
of Plautus scornfully exclaims that he would not
exchange his vocation, though low and groveling, with
that of the man who makes a legal proceeding "his net
wherein to catch another man's goods."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><i>Seventh Stage</i> (<i>impaneling the judges</i>).&mdash;But if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>the prosecutor appeared in due time, the trial formally
began by the impaneling of the judges. This was usually
done by the prætor or <i>iudex quæstionis</i> who, at the
beginning of the trial, placed the names of the complete
panel of jurors, inscribed on white tablets, into
an urn, and then drew out a certain number. Both
prosecutor and accused had the right to challenge a
limited number, as the names were being drawn. The
number of challenges allowed varied from time to
time.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Stage</i> (<i>beginning of the trial</i>).&mdash;When the
judges had been impaneled, the regular proceedings
began. The place of trial was the Forum. The curule
chair of the prætor and the benches of the judges, constituting
the tribunal, were here placed. On the
ground in front of the raised platform upon which the
prætor and judges sat, were arranged the benches of
the parties, their advocates and witnesses. Like the
ancient Hebrew law, Roman law required that criminal
cases should be tried only by daylight, that is, between
daybreak and one hour before sunset. At the
opening of the trial, the prosecutor, backed by the <i>subscriptores</i>,
and the accused, supported by his patrons
and advocates, appeared before the tribunal.</p>

<p>In a modern criminal trial the case is opened by the
introduction of testimony which is followed by regular
speeches of counsel for the people and the defendant.
In those jurisdictions where opening addresses are required
before the examination of the witnesses, the
purpose is to inform the jury of the facts which it is
proposed to prove. Argument and characterization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>are not permitted in these opening speeches. The real
speeches in which argument and illustration are permitted
come after the evidence has been introduced.
The purpose of these closing speeches is to assist the
jury in determining matters of fact from conflicting
testimony.</p>

<p>Under the Roman system of trial in criminal cases,
the order was reversed. The regular speeches containing
argument, characterization, and illustration, as
well as a statement of the facts proposed to be proved,
were made in the very beginning. Evidence was then
introduced to show that the orators had told the truth
in their speeches.</p>

<p>It is not practicable in this place to discuss the
kinds and relevancy of evidence under Roman criminal
procedure. Suffice it to say that slaves were always
examined under torture.</p>

<p>The close of the evidence was followed by the judgment
of the tribunal.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Stage</i> (<i>voting of the judges</i>).&mdash;The judges
voted by ballot, and a majority of votes decided the
verdict. The balloting was done with tablets containing
the letters A. (<i>absolvo</i>), C. (<i>condemno</i>) and N. L.
(<i>non liquet</i>). When the votes had been cast, the tablets
were then counted by the president of the tribunal.
If the result indicated a condemnation, he pronounced
the word <i>fecisse</i>; if an acquittal, the phrase, <i>non fecisse
videtur</i>; if a doubtful verdict (<i>non liquet</i>), the words
<i>amplius esse cognoscendum</i>. The result of a doubtful
(<i>non liquet</i>) verdict was a retrial of the case at some
future time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>Such were the main features of the trial of a capital
case at Rome at the date of the crucifixion. Such was
the model which, according to the best authorities,
Pilate was bound to follow in the trial of Jesus. Did
he imitate this model? Did he observe these rules and
regulations? We shall see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>ROMAN FORMS OF PUNISHMENT</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_a_ch05.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="A" title="A"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">A</span>CCORDING to Gibbon, the
laws of the Twelve Tables, like
the statutes of Draco, were written
in blood. These famous decrees
sanctioned the frightful
principle of the <i>lex talionis</i>; and
prescribed for numerous crimes
many horrible forms of punishment.
The hurling from the
Tarpeian Rock was mild in comparison with other
modes of execution. The traitor to his country had his
hands tied behind his back, his head shrouded in a veil,
was then scourged by a lictor, and was afterwards crucified,
in the midst of the Forum by being nailed to the
<i>arbor infelix</i>. A malicious incendiary, on a principle
of retaliation, was delivered to the flames. He was
burned to death by being wrapped in a garment covered
with pitch which was then set on fire.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A parricide
was cast into the Tiber or the sea, inclosed in a
sack, to which a cock, a viper, a dog, and a monkey had
been successively added as fit companions in death.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>But the development of Roman jurisprudence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>the growth of Roman civilization witnessed a gradual
diminution in the severity of penal sanctions, in the
case of free citizens, until voluntary exile was the worst
punishment to which a wearer of the toga was compelled
to submit. The Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited
the magistrates from putting any Roman citizen
to death. The principle underlying these laws was
the offspring of a proud and patriotic sentiment which
exempted the masters of the world from the extreme
penalties reserved for barbarians and slaves. Greenidge,
interpreting Cicero, very elegantly expresses this
sentiment: "It is a <i>facinus</i> to put a Roman citizen in
bonds, a <i>scelus</i> to scourge him, <i>prope parricidium</i> to
put him to death."</p>

<p>The subject of this volume limits the discussion in
this chapter to a single Roman punishment: Crucifixion.
Around this word gather the most frightful
memories and, at the same time, the sweetest and sublimest
hopes of the human race. A thorough appreciation
of the trial of Jesus, it is felt, renders necessary
a comparatively exhaustive treatment of the punishment
in which all the horrors and illegalities of the
proceedings against Him culminated.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Tradition attributes the origin of crucifixion,
the most frightful and inhuman form of punishment
ever known, to a woman, Semiramis, Queen of
Assyria. We are reminded by this that quartering,
drawing at a horse's tail, breaking on the wheel, burning
and torture with pincers, were provisions in a
codex bearing the name of a woman: Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>Crucifixion was practiced by the ancient Egyptians,
Carthaginians, Persians, Germans, Assyrians, Greeks,
and Romans. The Romans employed this form of
punishment on a colossal scale. The Roman general
Varus crucified 2,000 Jews in one day at the gates of
Jerusalem. The close of the war with Spartacus, the
gladiator, witnessed the crucifixion of 10,000 slaves between
Capua and Rome.</p>

<p>Crucifixion, as a form of punishment, was unknown
to the ancient Hebrews. The penalty of death was
enforced among them by burning, strangling, decapitation,
and stoning. The "hanging" of criminals "on
a tree," mentioned in Deut. xxi. 22, was a posthumous
indignity offered the body of the criminal after death
by stoning, and struck horror to the soul of every pious
Israelite who beheld it. Among the Romans also degradation
was a part of the infliction, since crucifixion
was peculiarly a <i>supplicium servile</i>. Only the vilest
criminals, among free men, such as were guilty of robbery,
piracy, assassination, perjury, sedition, treason,
and desertion from the army, met death in this way.
The <i>jus civitatis</i> protected Roman citizens against this
punishment.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Crucifixion.</i>&mdash;A sentence of death having
been pronounced by a Roman magistrate or tribunal,
scourging became a preliminary to execution. This
was done with the terrible <i>flagellum</i> into which the
soldiers frequently stuck nails, pieces of bone, and
other hard substances to heighten the pain which was
often so intense as to produce death. The victim was
generally bound to a column to be scourged. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>claimed by Jerome, Prudentius, Gregory of Tours, and
others that they had seen the one to which Jesus was
bound before His scourging began. After the flagellation,
the prisoner was conducted to the place of execution.
This was outside the city, often in some public
road, or other conspicuous place like the Campus
Martius at Rome. The criminal was compelled to
carry his own cross; and when he had arrived at the
place of crucifixion, he was compelled to watch the
preparations for his torture. Before his eyes and in his
presence, the cross was driven into the ground; and,
after having been stripped naked, he was lifted upon
and nailed to it. It sometimes happened that he was
stretched upon it first and then lifted with it from the
ground. The former method was the more common,
however, as it was desired to strike terror into the victim
by the sight of the erection of the cross. The body
was fastened to the cross by nails driven into the hands
and sometimes into the feet; more frequently, however,
the feet were merely bound by cords.</p>

<p>The pictures of crosses in works of art are misrepresentations,
in that they are too large and too high. The
real cross of antiquity was very little longer than the
victim, whose head was near the top, and whose feet
often hung only twelve or fifteen inches from the
ground. Pictorial art is also false because it fails to
show the projecting beam from near the center of the
cross upon which the criminal sat. That there was
such a beam is attested by the almost unanimous voice
of antiquity.</p>

<p>Crucifixion was conducted, under Roman auspices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>by a <i>carnifex</i>, or hangman, assisted by a band of soldiers.
At Rome, execution was done under the supervision
of the <i>Triumviri Capitales</i>. The duty of the
soldiers was not only to erect the cross and nail the victim
to it, but also to watch him until he was dead.
This was a necessary precaution to prevent friends and
relatives from taking the criminal down and from
carrying him away, since he sometimes continued to
live upon the cross during several days. If taken down
in time, the suffering man might easily be resuscitated
and restored to health. Josephus tells us that three
victims were ordered to be taken down by Titus at his
request, and that one of them recovered. "In the later
persecutions of the Christians, the guards remained
four or six days by the dead, in order to secure them
to the wild beasts and to cut off all possibility of burial
and resurrection; and in Lyons the Christians were not
once able by offers of much gold to obtain the privilege
of showing compassion upon the victims of the pagan
popular fury. Sometimes, however, particularly on
festival days, e.g., the birthdays of the emperors, the
corpse was given up to the friends of the deceased,
either for money or without money, although even
Augustus could be cruel enough to turn a deaf ear to
the entreaties of the condemned for sepulture."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Roman records tell us that the soldiers frequently
hastened death by breaking the legs of the criminal; at
other times, fires were built about the cross beneath
him; and, again, wild beasts were turned loose upon
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>It was the general custom to allow the body to remain
and rot upon the cross, or to be devoured by wild
beasts and birds of prey. "Distracted relatives and
friends saw the birds of prey attack the very faces of
those whom they loved; and piety often took pains to
scare away the birds by day and the beasts by night,
or to outwit the guards that watched the dead."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Sepulture was generally forbidden by law, though
there were exceptions to the rule. At the request of
Joseph of Arimathea, Pilate consented that Jesus
should be taken down and buried.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A national exception
seems also to have been made in the case of the
Jews on account of the requirements of Deut. xxi.
22, 23.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>&mdash;The following pathological phases of
death by crucifixion are from a treatise by the celebrated
physician, Richter (in John's "Bibl. Arch."),
which have been reproduced in Strong and McClintock's
"Cyclopedia":</p>

<p>"(1) The unnatural position and violent tension of
the body, which cause a painful sensation from the
least motion.</p>

<p>"(2) The nails, being driven through parts of the
hands and feet which are full of nerves and tendons
(and yet at a distance from the heart) create the most
exquisite anguish.</p>

<p>"(3) The exposure of so many wounds and lacerations
brings on inflammation, which tends to become
gangrene, and every movement increases the poignancy
of suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>"(4) In the distended parts of the body, more blood
flows through the arteries than can be carried back into
the veins: hence too much blood finds its way from the
aorta into the head and stomach, and the blood vessels
of the head become pressed and swollen. The general
obstruction of circulation which ensues causes an intense
excitement, exertion, and anxiety more intolerable
than death itself.</p>

<p>"(5) The inexpressible misery of <i>gradually increasing</i>
and lingering anguish.</p>

<p>"(6) Burning and raging thirst.</p>

<p>"Death by crucifixion (physically considered) is,
therefore, to be attributed to the sympathetic fever
which is excited by the wounds, and aggravated by
exposure to the weather, privation of water, and the
painfully constrained position of the body. Traumatic
fever corresponds, in intensity and in character, to the
local inflammation of the wound, is characterized by
heat, swelling, and great pain, the fever is highly inflammatory,
and the sufferer complains of heat, throbbing
headache, intense thirst, restlessness, and anxiety.
As soon as suppuration sets in, the fever somewhat
abates, and partially ceases as suppuration diminishes
and the stage of cicatrization approaches. But if the
wound be prevented from healing and suppuration
continues, the fever assumes a hectic character, and
will sooner or later exhaust the powers of life. When,
however, the inflammation of the wound is so intense
as to produce mortification, nervous depression is the
immediate consequence; and, if the cause of this excessive
inflammation of the wound still continues, as is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>the case in crucifixion, the sufferer rapidly sinks. He
is no longer sensible of pain, but his anxiety and sense
of prostration are excessive; hiccough supervenes, his
skin is moistened with a cold clammy sweat, and death
ensues. It is in this manner that death on the cross
must have taken place in an ordinarily healthy constitution."</p>

<p>The intense sufferings and prolonged agony of crucifixion
can be best illustrated by an account of several
cases of this form of punishment taken from history.</p>

<p>From the "Chrestomathia Arabica" of Kosegarten,
published in 1828, is taken the following story of the
execution of a Mameluke. The author of this work
gleaned the story from an Arabic manuscript entitled
"The Meadow of Flowers and the Fragrant Odour":</p>

<p>"It is said that he had killed his master for some
cause or other, and he was crucified on the banks of
the river Barada under the castle of Damascus, with
his face turned toward the East. His hands, arms, and
feet were nailed, and he remained so from midday on
Friday to the same hour on Sunday, when he died.
He was remarkable for his strength and prowess; he
had been engaged with his master in sacred war at
Askelon, where he slew great numbers of the Franks;
and when very young he had killed a lion. Several
extraordinary things occurred at his being nailed, as
that he gave himself up without resistance to the cross,
and without complaint stretched out his hands, which
were nailed and after them his feet: he in the meantime
looked on, and did not utter a groan, or change
his countenance or move his limbs. I have heard this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>from one who witnessed it, and he thus remained till
he died, patient and silent, without wailing, but looking
around him to the right and the left upon the people.
But he begged for water, and none was given
him, and he gazed upon it and longed for one drop of
it, and he complained of thirst all the first day, after
which he was silent, for God gave him strength."</p>

<p>Describing the punishments used in <span class="err" title="original: Madasgascar">Madagascar</span>,
Rev. Mr. Ellis says: "In a few cases of great enormity,
a sort of crucifixion has been resorted to; and, in addition
to this, burning or roasting at a slow fire, kept at
some distance from the sufferer, has completed the horrors
of this miserable death.... In the year 1825, a
man was condemned to crucifixion, who had murdered
a female for the sake of stealing her child. He carried
the child for sale to the public market, where the infant
was recognized, and the murderer detected. He
bore his punishment in the most hardened manner,
avenging himself by all the violence he was capable of
exercising upon those who dragged him to the place of
execution. Not a single groan escaped him during the
period he was nailed to the wood, nor while the cross
was fixed upright in the earth."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>More horrible still than punishment by crucifixion
was that of impalement and suspension on a hook.
The following description of the execution, in 1830,
at Salonica, of Chaban, a captain of banditti, is given
by Slade: "He was described by those who saw him as
a very fine-looking man, about thirty-five. As a preparatory
exercise, he was suspended by his arms for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>twelve hours. The following day a hook was thrust
into his side, by which he was suspended to a tree, and
there hung enduring the agony of thirst till the third
evening, when death closed the scene; but before that
about an hour the birds, already considering him their
own, had alighted upon his brow to pick his eyes.
During this frightful period he uttered no unmanly
complaints, only repeated several times, 'Had I known
that I was to suffer this infernal death, I would never
have done what I have. From the moment I led the
klephte's life I had death before my eyes, and was prepared
to meet it, but I expected to die as my predecessors,
by decapitation.'"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><i>The Cross.</i>&mdash;The instrument of crucifixion, called
the Cross, was variously formed. Lipsius and Gretser
have employed a twofold classification: the <i>crux simplex</i>,
and the <i>crux composita</i> or <i>compacta</i>. A single
upright stake was distinguished as a <i>crux simplex</i>.
The <i>crux composita</i>, the compound or actual cross,
was subject to the following modifications of form:
<i>Crux immissa</i>, formed as in the Figure &#10013;; <i>crux commissa</i>
thus formed <b>&#65332;</b>; and the <i>crux decussata</i>, the
cruciform figure, set diagonally after the manner of
the Roman letter X. It is generally thought that Jesus
was crucified upon the <i>crux immissa</i>, the "Latin
cross."</p>

<p>According to the well-known legend of the "Invention
of the Cross," the actual cross on which Jesus was
crucified was discovered in the year 326 <span class="small">A.D.</span> by the
Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>As the story goes, while visiting Jerusalem and the
scenes of the passion, she was guided to the summit of
Calvary by an aged Jew. Here an excavation was
made, and, at a considerable depth, three crosses were
found; and, with them, but lying aside by itself, was
the inscription, in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, placed
above the head of Christ at the time of the crucifixion.
To determine which of the three crosses was the one
upon which Jesus suffered, it was decided, at the suggestion
of Macarius, bishop of Jerusalem, to employ
a miracle. The sick were brought and required to
touch the three. According to the legend, the one
upon which the Savior died immediately imparted
miraculous healing. A church was at once built above
the excavation and in it was deposited the greater part
of the supposed real cross, and the remainder was sent
to Byzantium, and from there to Rome, where it was
placed in the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme,
built especially to receive the precious relic. The
genuineness of this relic was afterwards attested by a
Bull of Pope Alexander III.</p>

<p>In connection with the legend of the discovery of
the actual cross upon which Christ was crucified, goes
a secondary story that the nails used at the crucifixion
were also found at the same time and place. Later
tradition declared that one of these was thrown by
Helena into the Adriatic when swept by a terrific
storm, and that this was followed by an instantaneous
calm.</p>

<p>The popular impression among Christians that the
cross is exclusively a Christian religious symbol, seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>to be without historical foundation. It is quite certain,
indeed, that it was a religious emblem among several
ancient races before the beginning of the Christian
era.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians adored the cross with the
most holy veneration; and this sacred emblem was
carved upon many of their monuments. Several of
these monuments may be seen to-day in the British
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> A cross upon a Calvary may also be seen
upon the breast of one of the Egyptian mummies in
the Museum of the London University.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The ancient
Egyptians were accustomed to putting a cross on their
sacred cakes, just as the Christians of to-day do, on
Good Friday.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The cross was also adored by the ancient Greeks and
Romans, long before the crucifixion of Christ. Greek
crosses of equal arms adorn the tomb of Midas, the
ancient Phrygian king.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> One of the early Christian
Fathers, Minucius Felix, in a heated controversy with
the pagan Romans, charged them with adoration of
the cross. "As for adoration of the cross," said he to
the Romans, "which you object against us, I must tell
you that we neither adore crosses nor desire them.
You it is, ye Pagans, who worship wooden gods, who
are the most likely people to adore wooden crosses, as
being part of the same substance with your deities.
For what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards,
but crosses, gilt and beautiful? Your victorious trophies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span><i>not only represent a cross, but a cross with a man
upon it</i>."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It also seems that, at a time antedating the early Romans,
Etruscans and Sabines, a primitive race inhabited
the plains of Northern Italy, "to whom the cross
was a religious symbol, the sign beneath which they
laid their dead to rest; a people of whom history tells
nothing, knowing not their name; but of whom antiquarian
research has learned this, that they lived in
ignorance of the arts of civilization, that they dwelt in
villages built on platforms over lakes, and that they
trusted to the cross to guard, and maybe to revive, their
loved ones whom they committed to the dust."</p>

<p>The cross was also a sacred symbol among the ancient
Scandinavians. "It occurs," says Mr. R. P.
Knight, "on many Runic monuments found in Sweden
and Denmark, which are of an age long anterior to the
approach of Christianity to those countries, and, probably,
to its appearance in the world."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>When the Spanish missionaries first set foot on the
soil of Mexico, they were amazed to find that the Aztecs
worshiped the cross as an object of supreme veneration.
They found it suspended as a sacred symbol
and an august emblem from the walls of all the Aztec
temples.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> When they penetrated farther south and
entered Peru, they found that the Incas adored a cross
made out of a single piece of jasper.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "It appears,"
says "Chambers's Encyclopedia," "that the sign of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>cross was in use as an emblem having certain religious
and mystic meanings attached to it, long before the
Christian era; and the Spanish conquerors were astonished
to find it an object of religious veneration among
the nations of Central and South America."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>That the ancient Mexicans should have worshiped
the cross and also a crucified Savior, called Quetzalcoatle,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
is one of the strangest phenomena of sacred
history. It is a puzzle which the most eminent theologians
have found it impossible to solve. They have
generally contented themselves with declaring the
whole thing a myth built upon primitive superstition
and ignorance. This worship of the cross and Quetzalcoatle
was going on before Columbus discovered
America, and it seems impossible to establish any historical
or geographical connection between it and the
Christian worship of the cross and the crucified Jesus.</p>

<p>Several writers of eminence have contended that the
widespread adoration of the cross, as a sacred symbol,
among so many races of mankind, ancient and modern,
proves a universal spiritual impulse, culminating in
the crucifixion of Jesus as the common Savior of the
world. "It is more than a coincidence," says the Rev.
S. Baring-Gould, "that Osiris by the cross should give
life eternal to the spirits of the just; that with the cross
Thor should smite the head of the great Serpent, and
bring to life those who were slain; that beneath the
cross the Muysca mothers should lay their babes, trusting
to that sign to secure them from the power of evil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>spirits; that with that symbol to protect them, the ancient
people of Northern Italy should lay them down
in the dust."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>But it is not with the mythical crucifixions of mythical
gods that we have to deal. The real, historical
death of Jesus upon the cross with its accompanying
incidents of outrageous illegality is the purpose of this
treatise; and to the accomplishment of that design we
now return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>ROMAN LAW APPLICABLE TO THE TRIAL OF JESUS</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/cap_w-ch06.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="W" title="W"
class="floatl" />

<i><span class="hidden">W</span>HAT was the law of Rome in
relation to the trial of Jesus?</i>
The answer to this question is
referable to the main charge
brought against the Master before
Pilate. A single verse in
St. Luke contains the indictment:
"And they began to accuse
him, saying, We found this
fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give
tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a
King." Three distinct elements are wrapped up in
this general accusation; but they are all interwoven
with and culminate in the great charge that Jesus
claimed to be "Christ a King." Of this accusation
alone, Pilate took cognizance. And there is no mistake
as to its nature and meaning. It was High Treason
against Cæsar&mdash;the most awful crime known to Roman
law. This was the charge brought by the priests of
the Sanhedrin against the Nazarene. What then was
the law of Rome in relation to the crime of high treason?
The older Roman law, <i>crimen perduellionis</i>,
applied chiefly to offenses committed in the military
service. Deserters from the army were regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>traitors and punished as public enemies either by death
or interdiction of fire and water. Later Roman law
broadened the definition of treason until it comprehended
any offense against the Roman Commonwealth
that affected the dignity and security of the Roman
people. Ulpian, defining treason, says: "<i>Majestatis
crimen illud est quod adversus populum Romanum
vel adversus securitatem ejus committitur.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Cicero
very admirably describes the same crime as: "<i>Majestatem
minuere est de dignitate aut amplitudine aut
potestate populi aut eorum quibus populus potestatem
dedit aliquid derogare.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The substance of both these
definitions is this: Treason is an insult to the dignity
or an attack upon the sovereignty and security of the
Roman State. From time to time, various laws were
passed to define this crime and to provide penalties for
its commission. Chief among these were the <i>lex Julia
Majestatis</i>, 48 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Other laws of an earlier date were
the <i>lex Cornelia</i>, 81 <span class="small">B.C.</span>; <i>lex Varia</i>, 92 <span class="small">B.C.</span>; and the
<i>lex Appuleia</i>, 100 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The <i>lex Julia</i> was in existence
at the time of Christ, and was the basis of the Roman
law of treason until the closing years of the empire.
One of its provisions was that every accusation of treason
against a Roman citizen should be made by a written
libel. But it is not probable that provincials were
entitled to the benefit of this provision; and it was
not therefore an infraction of the law that the priests
and Pilate failed to present a written charge against
Jesus.</p>

</div>
<hr class="l1" />
<p>In studying the trial of Jesus and the charge brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>against Him, the reader should constantly remind himself
that the crucifixion took place during the reign of
Tiberius Cæsar, a morbid and capricious tyrant, whose
fretful and suspicious temper would kindle into fire at
the slightest suggestion of treason in any quarter.
Tacitus records fifty-two cases of prosecution for treason
during his reign. The enormous development of
the law of <i>majestas</i> at this time gave rise to a class of
professional informers, <i>delatores</i>, whose infamous activity
against private citizens helped to blacken the
name of Tiberius. The most harmless acts were at
times construed into an affront to the majesty or into
an assault upon the safety of this miserable despot.
Cotta Messalinus was prosecuted for treason because it
was alleged "that he had given Caligula the nickname
of Caia, as contaminated by incest"; and again on another
charge that he had styled a banquet among the
priests on the birthday of Augusta, a "funeral supper";
and again on another charge that, while complaining
of the influence of Manius Lepidus and
Lucius Arruntius, with whom he had had trouble in
court, he had said that "they indeed will be supported
by the senate, but I by my little Tiberius."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Manercus Scaurus was prosecuted for treason because
he wrote a tragedy in which were certain lines
that might be made to apply in an uncomplimentary
manner to Tiberius. We are told by Dio that this
tragedy was founded on the story of Atreus; and that
Tiberius, believing himself referred to, said, "Since
he makes me another Atreus, I will make him an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>Ajax," meaning that he would compel him to destroy
himself.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>"Nor," says Tacitus, "were even women exempt
from danger. With designs to usurp the government
they could not be charged; their tears are therefore
made treason; and Vitia, mother to Fusius Geminus,
once consul, was executed in her old age for bewailing
the death of her son."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>An anecdote taken from Seneca but related in Tacitus,
illustrates the pernicious activity of the political
informers of this age. At a banquet in Rome, one of
the guests wore the image of Tiberius on his ring.
His slave, seeing his master intoxicated, took the ring
off his finger. An informer noticed the act, and, later
in the evening, insisted that the owner, to show his contempt
of Tiberius, was sitting upon the figure of the
emperor. Whereupon he began to draw up an accusation
for high treason and was getting ready to have it
attested by subscribing witnesses, when the slave took
the ring from his own pocket, and thus demonstrated
to the whole company that he had had it in his possession
all the time. These instances fully serve to illustrate
the political tone and temper of the age that
witnessed the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They also
suggest the exceedingly delicate and painful position
of Pilate when sitting in judgment upon the life of a
subject of Tiberius who claimed to be a king.</p>

<p>It is deemed entirely appropriate, in this place, to
discuss a peculiar phase of the law of treason in its relationship
to the trial of Jesus. It is easily demonstrable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>that the teachings of Christ were treasonable
under Roman public law. An essential and dominating
principle of that law was that the imperial State
had the right to regulate and control the private consciences
of men in religious matters. It was held to
be an attribute of the sovereignty of Rome that she had
the right to create or destroy religions. And the theory
of the Roman constitution was that the exercise of
this right was not a religious but a governmental function.
The modern doctrine of the separation of
Church and State had no place in Roman politics at
the time of Christ. Tiberius Cæsar, at the beginning
of his reign, definitely adopted the principle of a state
religion, and as Pontifex Maximus, was bound to protect
the ancient Roman worship as a matter of official
duty.</p>

<p>Roman treatment of foreign religions, from first to
last, is a most interesting and fascinating study. Polytheistic
above all other nations, the general policy of
the Roman empire was one of toleration. Indeed she
not only tolerated but adopted and absorbed foreign
worships into her own. The Roman religion was a
composite of nearly all the religions of the earth. It
was thus natural that the imperial State should be indulgent
in religious matters, since warfare upon foreign
faiths would have been an assault upon integral
parts of her own sacred system. It is historically true
that attempts were made from time to time by patriotic
Romans to preserve the old Latin faith in its original
purity from foreign invasion. The introduction of
Greek gods was at first vigorously opposed, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>exquisite beauty of Greek sculpture, the irresistible influence
of Greek literature, and the overwhelming
fascination of Greek myths, finally destroyed this
opposition, and placed Apollo and Æsculapius in the
Roman pantheon beside Jupiter and Minerva.</p>

<p>At another time the senate declared war on the
Egyptian worship which was gradually making its
way into Rome. It had the images of Isis and Serapis
thrown down; but the people set them up again. It
decreed that the temples to these deities should be destroyed,
but not a single workman would lay hands
upon them. Æmilius Paulus, the consul, was himself
forced to seize an ax and break in the doors of the
temple. In spite of this, the worship of Isis and Serapis
was soon again practiced unrestrained at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It is further true that Rome showed not only intolerance
but mortal antagonism to Druidism, which was
completely annihilated during the reign of the Emperor
Claudius.</p>

<p>A decree of the Roman senate, during the reign of
Tiberius, ordered four thousand freemen charged with
Egyptian and Jewish superstitions out to Sardinia to
fight against and be destroyed by the banditti there,
unless they saw fit to renounce these superstitions
within a given time.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>But it must be remembered that these are exceptional
cases of intolerance revealed by Roman history.
The general policy of the empire, on the other hand,
was of extreme tolerance and liberality. The keynote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>of this policy was that all religions would be tolerated
that consented to live side by side and in peace with all
other religions. There was but one restriction upon
and limitation of this principle, that foreign religions
would be tolerated only in their local seats, or, at most,
among the races in which such religions were native.
The fact that the worship of Serapis was left undisturbed
on the banks of the Nile, did not mean that the
same worship would be tolerated on the banks of the
Tiber. An express authorization by Rome was necessary
for this purpose. Said authorization made said
worship a <i>religio licita</i>. And the peregrini, or foreigners
in Rome, were thus permitted to erect their
own altars, and to assemble for the purpose of worshiping
their own gods which they had brought with them.
The reverse side of this general principle of religious
tolerance shows that Roman citizens were not only
permitted but required to carry the Roman faith with
them throughout the world. Upon them, the Roman
state religion was absolutely binding; and for all the
balance of the world it was the dominant cult. "The
provinces," says Renan, "were entirely free to adhere
to their own rights, on the sole condition of not interfering
with those of others." "Such toleration or indifference,
however," says Döllinger, "found its own
limits at once whenever the doctrine taught had a practical
bearing on society, interfered with the worship
of the state gods, or confronted their worship with one
of its own; as well as when a strange god and <i>cultus</i>
assumed a hostile attitude toward Roman gods, could
be brought into no affinity or corporate relation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>them, and would not bend to the supremacy of Jupiter
Capitolinus."</p>

<p>Now, the principles declared by Renan and Döllinger
are fundamental and pointed in the matter of the
relationship between the teachings of Jesus and the
theory of treason under Roman law. These principles
were essential elements of Roman public law, and an
attempt to destroy them was an act of treason under the
definitions of both Ulpian and Cicero. The Roman
constitution required that a foreign religion, as a condition
of its very existence, should live in peace with
its neighbors; that it should not make war upon or seek
to destroy other religions; and that it should acknowledge
the dominance and superior character of the
imperial religion. All these things Jesus refused to do,
as did his followers after Him. The Jews, it is true,
had done the same thing, but their nationality and lack
of aggressiveness saved them until the destruction of
Jerusalem. But Christianity was essentially aggressive
and proselytizing. It sought to supplant and destroy
all other religions. No compromises were proposed,
no treaties concluded. The followers of the Nazarene
raised a black flag against paganism and every heathen
god. Their strange faith not only defied all other religions,
but mocked all earthly government not built
upon it. Their propaganda was nothing less than a
challenge to the Roman empire in the affairs of both
law and religion. Here was a faith which claimed to
be the only true religion; that proclaimed a monotheistic
message which was death to polytheism; and that
refused to be confined within local limits. Here was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>a religion that scorned an authorization from Rome to
worship its god and prophet; a religion that demanded
acceptance and obedience from all the world&mdash;from
Roman and Greek, as well as Jew and Egyptian. This
scorn and this demand were an affront to the dignity
and a challenge to the laws of the Roman Commonwealth.
Such conduct was treason against the constitution
of the empire.</p>

<p>"The substance of what the Romans did," says Sir
James Fitz-James Stephen, "was to treat Christianity
by fits and starts as a crime."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But why a crime? Because
the Roman religion, built upon polytheism, was
an integral and inseparable part of the Roman State,
and whatever menaced the life of the one, threatened
the existence of the other. The Romans regarded their
religion as "an engine of state which could not be
shaken without the utmost danger to their civil government."
Cicero further says: "The institutions of
the fathers must be defended; it is the part of wisdom
to hold fast the sacred rites and ceremonies."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Roman
statesmen were fully aware of the truthfulness of the
statement of a modern writer that, "wherever the religion
of any state falls into disregard and contempt
it is impossible for that state to subsist long." Now,
Christianity was monotheistic, and threatened destruction
to polytheism everywhere. And the Romans
treated it as a crime because it was regarded as a form
of seditious atheism whose teachings and principles
were destructive of the established order of things.
The Roman conception of the nature of the crime committed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>by an attack upon the national religion is well
illustrated by the following sentence from Döllinger:
"If an opinion unfavorable to the apotheosis of any
member of the imperial dynasty happened to be
dropped, it was dangerous in itself as falling within
the purview of the law of high treason; and so it fell
out in the case of Thrasea Pætus, who refused to believe
in the deification of Poppæa." If it was high
treason to refuse to believe in the deification of an emperor
or an empress, what other crime could be imputed
to him whose design was to destroy an entire
religious system, and to pile all the gods and goddesses&mdash;Juno
and Poppæa, Jupiter and Augustus&mdash;in common
ruin?</p>

<p>From the foregoing, it may be readily seen that it is
impossible to appreciate the legal aspects of the trial
of Jesus before Pilate, unless it is constantly kept in
mind that the Roman constitution, which was binding
upon the whole empire, reserved to the state the right
to permit or forbid the existence of new religious
faiths and the exercise of rights of conscience in religious
matters. Rome was perfectly willing to tolerate
all religions as long as they were peaceful and passive
in their relations with other religions. But when a
new and aggressive faith appeared upon the scene,
proclaiming the strange dogma that there was but one
name under heaven whereby men might be saved, and
demanding that every knee bow at the mention of that
name, and threatening damnation upon all who refused,
the majesty of Roman law felt itself insulted and
outraged; and persecution, torture, and death were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>inevitable result. The best and wisest of the Roman
emperors, Trajan and the Antonines, devoted to the
ax or condemned to crucifixion the early Christians,
not because Christianity was spiritually false, but
because it was aggressive and intolerant, and they believed
its destruction necessary to the maintenance of
the supremacy and sovereignty of the Roman State.</p>

<p>An interesting correspondence between Pliny and
Trajan, while the former was governor of Bithynia,
reveals the Roman conception of and attitude toward
Christianity. Pliny wrote to Trajan: "In the meanwhile,
the method I have observed toward those who
have been brought before me as Christians is this: I
asked them whether they were Christians; if they admitted
it, I repeated the question twice, and threatened
them with punishment; if they persisted, I ordered
them to be at once punished, for I was persuaded,
whatever the nature of their opinions might be, a contumacious
and inflexible obstinacy certainly deserved
correction. There were others also brought before me
possessed with the same infatuation, but being Roman
citizens, I directed them to be sent to Rome."</p>

<p>To this, Trajan replied: "You have adopted the
right course, my dearest Secundus, in investigating the
charges against the Christians who were brought before
you. It is not possible to lay down any general
rule for all such cases. Do not go out of your way to
look for them. If, indeed, they should be brought
before you, and the crime is proved, they must be punished;
with the restriction, however, that where the
party denies he is a Christian, and shall make it evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>he is not, by invoking our gods, let him (notwithstanding
any former suspicion) be pardoned upon his repentance."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Here the magnanimous Trajan called
Christianity a crime, and this was the popular Roman
conception of it during the first two centuries of its
existence.</p>

<p>Now, it is true that Christianity was not on trial
before Pilate; but the Author of Christianity was.
And the same legal principles were extant and applicable
that afterwards brought the Roman State and the
followers of the Nazarene into mortal conflict. For
the prisoner who now stood before the procurator to
answer the charge of high treason asserted substantially
the same claims and proclaimed the same doctrines
that afterwards caused Rome to devote His
adherents to flames and to wild beasts in the amphitheater.
The record does not disclose that Pilate became
fully acquainted at the trial of Jesus with His claims
and doctrines. On the other hand, it is clear that he
became convinced that the claim of Jesus to be "Christ
a King" was not a pretension to earthly sovereignty.
But, nevertheless, whatever might have been the information
or the notions of the deputy of Tiberius, the
teachings of Jesus were inconsistent and incompatible
with the public law of the Roman State. Pilate was
not necessarily called upon to enforce this law, since
it was frequently the duty of Roman governors, as intimated
by Trajan in his letter to Pliny, to exercise
leniency in dealing with religious delinquents.</p>

<p>To summarize, then: it may be said that the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>law applicable to the trial of Jesus was the <i>lex Julia
Majestatis</i>, interpreted either in the light of claims to
actual kingship made by Jesus, or to kingship of a
religious realm whose character and existence were a
menace to the religion and laws of Rome. In the light
of the evidence adduced at the hearing before Pilate,
these legal principles become mere abstract propositions,
since there seems to have been neither necessity
nor attempt to enforce them; but they were in existence,
nevertheless, and were directly applicable to the
trial of Jesus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>PONTIUS PILATE</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_h-ch07.jpg" width="100" height="111" alt="H" title="H"
class="floatl" />

<i><span class="hidden">H</span>IS Name.</i>&mdash;The prænomen or
first name of Pilate is not known.
Rosadi calls him Lucius, but
upon what authority is not
stated. His nomen or family
name indicates that he was connected
either by descent or by
adoption with the gens of the
Pontii, a tribe first made famous
in Roman history in the person and achievements of C.
Pontius Telesinus, the great Samnite general. A German
legend, however, offers another explanation. According
to this story, Pilate was the natural son of
Tyrus, King of Mayence. His father sent him to Rome
as a hostage, and there he was guilty of murder. Afterwards
he was sent to Pontus, where he distinguished
himself by subduing certain barbarian tribes. In recognition
of his services, it is said, he received the name
Pontius. But this account is a pure fabrication. It is
possible that it was invented by the 22d legion, which
was assigned to Palestine at the time of the destruction
of Jerusalem, and was afterwards stationed at Mayence.
The soldiers of this legion might have been
"either the bearers of this tradition or the inventors
of the fable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>It is historically almost certain that Pilate was a native
of Seville, one of the cities of Bætic Spain that
enjoyed rights of Roman citizenship. In the war of
annihilation waged by Agrippa against the Cantabrians,
the father of Pilate, Marcus Pontius, acquired
fame as a general on the side of Rome. He seems to
have been a renegade to the cause of the Spaniards, his
countrymen. And when Spain had been conquered by
Rome, as a reward for service, and as a mark of distinction,
he received the pilum (javelin), and from
this fact his family took the name of Pilati. This is
the common explanation of the origin of the cognomen
Pilatus.</p>

<p>Others have sought to derive the word Pilate from
<i>pileatus</i>, which, among the Romans, was the cap worn
as a badge of servitude by manumitted slaves. This
derivation would make Pontius Pilate a <i>libertus</i>, or the
descendant of one.</p>

<p>Of his youth, very little is known. But it is believed
that, after leaving Spain, he entered the suite of Germanicus
on the Rhine and served through the German
campaigns; and that, when peace was concluded, he
went to Rome in search of fortune and in pursuit of
pleasure.</p>

<p><i>His Marriage.</i>&mdash;Soon after his arrival in Rome,
Pilate was married to Claudia, the youngest daughter
of Julia, the daughter of Augustus. Julia was a
woman of the most dissolute and reckless habits. According
to Suetonius, nothing so embittered the life of
the Roman emperor as the shameful conduct of the
mother of the wife of the procurator of Judea. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>had reared her with the utmost care, had accustomed
her to domestic employments such as knitting and spinning,
and had sought to inculcate principles of purity
and nobility of soul by requiring her to speak and act
openly before the family, that everything which was
said and done might be put down in a diary. His
guardianship of the attentions paid her by young men
was so strict that he once wrote a letter to Lucius Vinicius,
a handsome young man of good family, in which
he said: "You have not behaved very modestly, in
making a visit to my daughter at Baiæ." Notwithstanding
this good training, Julia became one of the
lewdest and coarsest women in Rome. Augustus married
her first to Marcellus; then, after the death of
Marcellus, to Marcus Agrippa; and, finally, to Tiberius.
But in spite of the noble matches that had been
made for her, her lewdness and debaucheries became
so notorious that Augustus was compelled to banish her
from Rome. It is said that he was so much ashamed of
her infamous conduct that for a long time he avoided
all company, and even had thoughts of putting her to
death. His sorrow and humiliation are shown from
the circumstance that when one Ph&#339;be, a freedwoman
and confidante of hers, hanged herself about the time
the decree of banishment was passed by the senate, he
said: "I had rather be the father of Ph&#339;be than of
Julia." And whenever the name of Julia was mentioned
to him, during her exile, Augustus was wont to
exclaim: "Would I were wifeless, or had childless
died."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>Such was the character of Julia, mother-in-law of
Pilate. In exile, she bore Claudia to a Roman knight.
In her fifteenth year, the young girl met the Spaniard
in Rome and was courted by him. Nothing better illustrates
the character of Pilate than his union with
this woman with whose origin and bringing up he was
well acquainted. It was a servile and lustful rather
than a noble and affectionate eye which he cast upon
her. Having won the favor of Tiberius and the consent
of Claudia, the marriage was consummated.
After the nuptial rites, tradition has it that Pilate desired
to follow the bride in the imperial litter; but
Tiberius, who had acted as one of the twelve witnesses
required by the law, forced him back, and drawing a
paper from his bosom, handed it to him and passed on.
This paper contained his commission as procurator of
Judea; and the real object of the suit paid to Claudia
was attained.</p>

<p>Pilate proceeded at once to Cæsarea, the headquarters
of the government of his province. His wife, who
had been left behind, joined him afterwards. Cæsar's
permission to do this was a most gracious concession,
as it was not generally allowed that governors of provinces
should take their wives with them. At first it was
positively forbidden. But afterwards a <i>senatus consult</i>,
which is embodied in the Justinian text, declared
it better that the wives of proconsuls and procurators
should not go with them, but ordaining that said officials
might take their wives with them provided they
made themselves personally responsible for any transgressions
on their part. Notwithstanding the numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>restrictions of Roman law and custom, it is very
evident that the wives of Roman officers frequently
accompanied them to the provinces. From Tacitus we
learn that at the time of the death of Augustus, Germanicus
had his wife Agrippina with him in Germany;
and afterwards, in the beginning of the reign
of Tiberius, she was also with him in the East. Piso,
the præfect of Syria, took his wife with him at the same
time. These facts are historical corroborations of the
Gospel accounts of the presence of Claudia in Jerusalem
at the time of the crucifixion and of her warning
dream to Pilate concerning the fate of the Master.</p>

<p><i>His Procuratorship.</i>&mdash;Pontius Pilate was the sixth
procurator of Judea. Sabinus, Coponius, Ambivus,
Rufus, and Gratus had preceded him in the government
of the province. Pilate's connection with the
trial and crucifixion of Jesus will be dealt with in succeeding
chapters of this volume. Only the chief acts
of his public administration, in a purely political capacity,
will be noticed here. One of the first of these
acts serves well to illustrate the reckless and tactless
character of the man. His predecessors in office had
exercised great care in the matter of the religious
prejudices of the Jews. They had studiously avoided
exhibiting flags and other emblems bearing images of
the emperor that might offend the sacred sentiments
of the native population. Even Vitellius, the legate of
Syria, when he was marching against the Arabian king
Aretas, ordered his troops not to carry their standards
into Jewish territory, but to march around it. Pilate,
on the other hand, in defiance of precedent and policy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>caused the garrison soldiers of Jerusalem to enter the
city by night carrying aloft their standards, blazoned
with the images of Tiberius. The news of this outrage
threw the Jews into wild excitement. The people in
great numbers flocked down to Cæsarea, where Pilate
was still stopping, and begged him to remove the
standards. Pilate refused; and for five days the discussion
went on. At last he became enraged, summoned
the people into the race course, had them surrounded
by a detachment of soldiers, and served notice
upon them that he would have them put to death if
they did not become quiet and disperse. But, not in
the least dismayed, they threw themselves upon the
ground, laid bare their necks, and, in their turn, served
notice upon Pilate that they, the children of Abraham,
would rather die, and that they would die, before they
would willingly see the Holy City defiled. The result
was that Pilate finally yielded, and had the standards
and images withdrawn from Jerusalem. Such was the
Roman procurator and such the people with whom he
had to deal. Thus the very first act of his procuratorship
was a blunder which embarrassed his whole subsequent
career.</p>

<p>A new storm burst forth when, on another occasion,
Pilate appropriated funds from the Corban or sacred
treasury to complete an aqueduct for bringing water to
Jerusalem from the "Pools of Solomon." This was
certainly a most useful enterprise; and, ordinarily,
would speak well for the statesmanship and administrative
ability of the procurator. But, in this instance,
it was only another exhibition of tactless behavior in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>dealing with a stubborn and peculiar people. The
Jews had a very great reverence for whatever was set
apart for the Corban, and they considered it a form
of awful impiety to devote its funds to secular purposes.
Pilate, we must assume, was well acquainted
with their religious scruples in this regard, and his
open defiance of their prejudices was an illustration
not of courage, but of weakness in administrative matters.
Moreover, his final conduct in the matter of the
aqueduct revealed a malignant quality in the temper
of the man. On one occasion when he was getting
ready to go to Jerusalem to supervise the building of
this work, he learned that the people would again importune
him, as in the case of the standards and the
images. He then deliberately caused some of his soldiers
to be disguised as Jewish citizens, had them
armed with clubs and daggers, which they carried concealed
beneath their upper garments; and when the
multitude approached him to make complaints and to
present their petitions, he gave a preconcerted signal,
at which the assassins beat down and cut to pieces great
numbers of the helpless crowds. Pilate was victorious
in this matter; for the opposition to the building of
the aqueduct was thus crushed in a most bloody manner.
But hatred against Pilate was stirred up afresh
and intensified in the hearts of the Jews.</p>

<p>A third act of defiance of the religious prejudices of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem illustrates not only the obstinacy
but the stupidity as well of the deputy of Cæsar
in Judea. In the face of his previous experiences, he
insisted on hanging up in Herod's palace certain gilt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>shields dedicated to Tiberius. The Jews remonstrated
with him in vain for this new outrage upon their
national feelings. They were all the more indignant
because they believed that he had done it, "less for the
honor of Tiberius than for the annoyance of the Jewish
people." Upon the refusal of Pilate to remove the
shields, a petition signed by the leading men of the nation,
among whom were the four sons of Herod, was
addressed to the emperor, asking for the removal of
the offensive decorations. Tiberius granted the request
and the shields were taken from Jerusalem and deposited
in the temple of Augustus at Cæsarea&mdash;"And thus
were preserved both the honor of the emperor and the
ancient customs of the city."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The instances above cited are recounted in the works
of Josephus<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and Philo. But the New Testament also
contains intimations that Pilate was a cruel and reckless
governor in his dealings with the Jews. According
to St. Luke xiii. 1: "There were present at that
season some that told him of the Galileans, whose
blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices." Nothing
definite is known of this incident mentioned by
the Evangelist. But it probably refers to the fact
that Pilate had put to the sword a number of Galileans
while they were offering their sacrifices at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><i>His Character.</i>&mdash;The estimates of the character of
Pilate are as varied as the races and creeds of men.
Both Josephus and Philo have handed down to posterity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>a very ugly picture of the sixth Roman procurator
of Judea. Philo charges him with "corruptibility,
violence, robberies, ill-treatment of the people, grievances,
continuous executions without even the form of
a trial, endless and intolerable cruelties." If we were
to stop with this, we should have a very poor impression
of the deputy of Tiberius; and, indeed at best, we
can never either admire or love him. But there is a
tender and even pathetic side to the character of Pilate,
which is revealed to us by the Evangelists of the New
Testament. The pure-hearted, gentle-minded authors
of the Gospels, in whose writings there is not even a
tinge of bitterness or resentment, have restored "for us
the man within the governor, with a delicacy, and even
tenderness, which make the accusing portrait of Philo
and Josephus look like a hard, revengeful daub." Instead
of painting him as a monster, they have linked
conscience to his character and placed mercy in his
heart, by their accounts of his repeated attempts to release
Jesus. The extreme of pity and of pathos, derived
from these exquisitely merciful side touches of
the gentle biographers of the Christ, is manifested in
the opinion of Tertullian that Pilate was virtually a
Christian at heart.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>A further manifestation is the fact that the Abyssinian
Church of Christians has canonized him and
placed his name in the calendar on June 25th.</p>

<p>A still further revelation of this spirit of regarding
Pilate merely as a sacred instrument in the hands of
God is shown by the Apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>which speaks of him as "uncircumcised in flesh
but circumcised in heart."</p>

<p>Renan has called him a good administrator, and has
sought to condone his brutal treatment of the Jews by
pointing to the necessity of vigorous action in dealing
with a turbulent and fanatical race. But the combined
efforts of both sacred and secular apologists are still not
sufficient to save the name of Pilate from the scorn and
reprobation of mankind. That he was not a bad man
in the worst sense of the term is manifest from the
teachings of the Gospel narratives. To believe that he
was wholly without conscience is to repudiate the revelations
of these sacred writings. Of wanton cruelty
and gratuitous wickedness, he was perhaps incapable.
But the circumstances of his birth and breeding; his
descent from a renegade father; his adventurous life
in the army of Germanicus; his contact with and absorption
of the skepticism and debauchery of Rome;
his marriage to a woman of questionable virtue whose
mother was notoriously coarse and lewd&mdash;all these
things had given coloring to the character of Pilate
and had stricken with inward paralysis the moral fiber
of his manhood. And now, in the supreme moment of
his life and of history, from his nerveless grasp fell the
reins of fate and fortune that destiny had placed within
his hands. Called upon to play a leading rôle in the
mighty drama of the universe, his craven cowardice
made him a pitiable and contemptible figure. A
splendid example this, the conduct of Pilate, for the
youth of the world, not to imitate but to shun! Let
the young men of America and of all the earth remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>that a crisis is allotted to every life. It may be a
great one or a small one, but it will come either invited
or unbidden. The sublime courage of the soul does not
avoid, but seeks this crisis. The bravest and most holy
aspirations leap at times like angels from the temple
of the brain to the highest heaven. Never a physician
who does not long for the skill that discovers a remedy
for disease and that will make him a Pasteur or a
Koch; never a poet that does not beseech the muse to
inspire him to write a Hamlet or a Faust; never a general
of armies who would not fight an Austerlitz battle.
Every ambitious soul fervently prays for strength,
when the great crisis comes, to swing the hammer of
the Cyclop with the arm of the Titan. Let the young
aspirant for the glories of the earth and the rewards of
heaven remember that youth is the time for the formation
of that courage and the gathering of that strength
of which victory is born. Let him remember that if he
degrades his physical and spiritual manhood in early
life, the coming of the great day of his existence will
make him another Pilate&mdash;cringing, crouching, and
contemptible.</p>

<p>The true character of the Roman judge of Jesus is
thus very tersely given by Dr. Ellicott: "A thorough
and complete type of the later Roman man of the
world: stern, but not relentless; shrewd and worldworn,
prompt and practical, haughtily just, and yet, as
the early writers correctly perceived, self-seeking and
cowardly; able to perceive what was right, but without
moral strength to follow it out."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span><i>His End.</i>&mdash;Pilate's utter recklessness was the final
cause of his undoing. It was an old belief among the
Samaritans that Moses buried the sacred vessels of
the temple on Mt. Gerizim. An impostor, a sort of
pseudo-prophet, promised the people that if they
would assemble on the top of the mountain, he would
unearth the holy utensils in their presence. The simple-minded
Samaritans assembled in great numbers at
the foot of the Mount, and there preparing to ascend,
when Pilate on the pretense that they were revolutionists,
intercepted them with a strong force of horse and
foot. Those who did not immediately submit were
either slain or put to flight. The most notable among
the captives were put to death. The Samaritans at
once complained to Vitellius, the legate in Syria at that
time. Vitellius at once turned over the administration
of Judea to Marcellus and ordered Pilate to leave for
Rome in order to give an account to the emperor of the
charges brought against him by the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Before he
arrived in Italy, Tiberius had died; but Pilate never
returned to the province over which he had ruled during
ten bloody and eventful years.</p>

<p>"<i>Paradosis Pilati.</i>"&mdash;The death of Pilate is clouded
in mystery and legend. Where and when he died is
not known. Two apocryphal accounts are interesting,
though false and ridiculous. According to one legend,
the "Paradosis Pilati," the emperor Tiberius, startled
and terrified at the universal darkness that had fallen
on the Roman world at the hour of the crucifixion,
summoned Pilate to Rome to answer for having caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>it. He was found guilty and condemned to death; but
before he was executed, he prayed to Jesus that he
might not be destroyed in eternity with the wicked
Jews, and pleaded ignorance as an excuse for having
delivered the Christ to be crucified. A voice from
heaven answered his prayer, and assured him that all
generations would call him blessed, and that he should
be a witness for Christ at his second coming to judge
the Twelve Tribes of Israel. He was then executed;
an angel, according to the legend, received his head;
and his wife died from joy and was buried with
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Mors Pilati.</i>"&mdash;According to another legend, the
"Mors Pilati," Tiberius had heard of the miracles of
healing wrought by Jesus in Judea. He ordered Pilate
to conduct to Rome the man possessed of such
divine power. But Pilate was forced to confess that
he had crucified the miracle worker. The messenger
sent by Tiberius met Veronica who gave him the cloth
that had received the impress of the divine features.
This was taken to Rome and given to the emperor, who
was restored to health by it. Pilate was summoned
immediately to stand trial for the execution of the
Christ. He presented himself wearing the holy tunic.
This acted as a charm upon the emperor, who temporarily
relented. After a time, however, Pilate was
thrown into prison, where he committed suicide. His
body was thrown into the Tiber. Storms and tempests
immediately followed, and the Romans were compelled
to take out the corpse and send it to Vienne,
where it was cast into the Rhone. But as the storms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>and tempests came again, the body was again removed
and sent to Lucerne, where it was sunk in a deep pool,
surrounded by mountains on all sides. Even then, it
is said, the water of the pool began to boil and bubble
strangely.</p>

<p>This tradition must have had its origin in an early
attempt to connect the name of Pilate with Mt. Pilatus
that overlooks Lake Lucerne. Another legend connected
with this mountain is that Pilate sought to find
an asylum from his sorrows in its shadows and recesses;
that, after spending years in remorse and despair,
wandering up and down its sides, he plunged into the
dismal lake which occupies its summit. In times past,
popular superstition was wont to relate how "a form
is often seen to emerge from the gloomy waters, and
go through the action of washing his hands; and
when he does so, dark clouds of mist gather first
round the bosom of the Infernal Lake (such as it
has been styled of old) and then wrapping the whole
upper part of the mountain in darkness, presage a
tempest or hurricane which is sure to follow in a
short space."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The superstitious Swiss believed for many centuries
that if a stone were thrown into the lake a violent
storm would follow. For many years no one was permitted
to visit it without special authority from the
officers of Lucerne. The neighboring shepherds bound
themselves by a solemn oath, which they renewed annually,
never to guide a stranger to it.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>spell was broken, however, and the legend exploded in
1584, when Johannes Müller, curé of Lucerne, was
bold enough to throw stones into the lake, and to stand
by complacently to await the consequences.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>JESUS BEFORE PILATE</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_a_ch05.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="A" title="A"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">A</span>T the close of their trial, according
to Matthew<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and Mark,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the
high priest and the entire Sanhedrin
led Jesus away to the tribunal
of the Roman governor.
It was early morning, probably
between six and seven o'clock,
when the accusing multitude
moved from the judgment seat
of Caiaphas to the Prætorium of Pilate. Oriental
labor anticipates the day because of the excessive heat
of noon; and, at daybreak, Eastern life is all astir. To
accommodate the people and to enjoy the repose of
midday, Roman governors, Suetonius tells us, mounted
the <i>bema</i> at sunrise. The location of the judgment
hall of Pilate in Jerusalem is not certainly known. It
may have been in the Castle of Antonia, a frowning
fortress that overlooked the Temple and its courts.
Much more probably, however, it was the magnificent
palace of Herod, situated in the northwest quarter of
the city. This probability is heightened by the fact
that it was a custom born of both pride and pleasure,
for Roman procurators and proconsuls to occupy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>splendid edifices of the local kings. The Roman proprætor
of Sicily dwelt in the Castle of King Hiero;
and it is reasonable to suppose that Pilate would have
passed his time while at Jerusalem in the palace of
Herod. This building was frequently called the
"King's Castle," sometimes was styled the "Prætorium,"
and was often given the mixed name of
"Herod's Prætorium." But, by whatever name
known, it was of gorgeous architecture and magnificent
proportions. Keim describes it as "a tyrant's
stronghold and in part a fairy pleasure-house." A
wall thirty cubits high completely encircled the buildings
of the palace. Beautiful white towers crowned
this wall at regular intervals. Three of these were
named in honor of Mariamne, the wife; Hippicus,
the friend; and Phasælus, the brother of the king.
Within the inclosure of the wall, a small army could
have been garrisoned. The floors and ceilings of the
palace were decorated and adorned with the finest
woods and precious stones. Projecting from the main
building were two colossal marble wings, named for
two Roman imperial friends, the Cæsareum and the
Ægrippeum. To a person standing in one of the towers,
a magnificent prospect opened to the view. Surrounding
the castle walls were beautiful green parks,
intercepted with broad walks and deep canals. Here
and there splashing fountains gushed from brazen
mouths. A hundred dovecots, scattered about the
basins and filled with cooing and fluttering inmates,
lent charm and animation to the scene. And to crown
the whole, was the splendid panorama of Jerusalem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>stretching away among the hills and valleys. Such was
the residence of the Roman knight who at this time
ruled Judea. And yet, with all its regal splendor and
magnificence, he inhabited it only a few weeks in each
year. The Jewish metropolis had no fascination whatever
for the tastes and accomplishments of Pilate.
"The saddest region in the world," says Renan, who
had been imbued, from long residence there, with its
melancholy character, "is perhaps that which surrounds
Jerusalem." "To the Spaniard," says Rosadi,
"who had come to Jerusalem, by way of Rome, and
who was also of courtly origin, there could have been
nothing pleasing in the parched, arid and colorless nature
of Palestine, much less in the humble, mystic, out-at-elbows
existence of its people. Their superstition,
which would have nothing of Roman idolatry, which
was their sole belief, their all, appeared to him a reasonable
explanation, and a legitimate one, of their disdain
and opposition. He therefore detested the Jews,
and his detestation was fully reciprocated." It is
not surprising, then, that he preferred to reside at
Cæsarea by the sea where were present Roman modes
of thought and forms of life. He visited Jerusalem as
a matter of official duty, "during the festivals, and
particularly at Easter with its dreaded inspirations of
the Jewish longing for freedom, which the festival, the
air of spring and the great rendezvous of the nation,
charmed into activity." In keeping with this custom,
Pilate was now in the Jewish Capital on the occasion
of the feast of the Passover.</p>

<p>Having condemned Him to death themselves, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>Sanhedrin judges were compelled to lead Jesus away
to the Prætorium of the Roman governor to see what
he had to say about the case; whether he would reverse
or affirm the condemnation which they had pronounced.
Between dawn and sunrise, they were at the
palace gates. Here they were compelled to halt. The
Passover had commenced, and to enter the procurator's
palace at such a time was to incur Levitic contamination.
A dozen judicial blunders had marked the proceedings
of their own trial in the palace of Caiaphas.
And yet they hesitated to violate a purely ritual regulation
in the matter of ceremonial defilement. This
regulation was a prohibition to eat fermented food
during the Passover Feast, and was sacred to the memory
of the great deliverance from Egyptian bondage
when the children of Israel, in their flight, had no time
to ferment their dough and were compelled to consume
it before it had been leavened. Their purposes and
scruples were announced to Pilate; and, in a spirit of
gracious and politic condescension, he removed the
difficulty by coming out to meet them. But this action
was really neither an inconvenience nor a condescension;
for it was usual to conduct Roman trials in the
open air. Publicity was characteristic of all Roman
criminal proceedings. And, in obedience to this principle,
we find that the proconsul of Achaia at Corinth,
the city magistrates in Macedonia, and the procurators
at Cæsarea and Jerusalem, erected their tribunals in
the most conspicuous public places, such as the market,
the race course, and even upon the open highway.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>example directly in point is, moreover, that of the
procurator Florus who caused his judgment seat to be
raised in front of the palace of Herod, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 66, and, enthroned
thereon, received the great men of Jerusalem
who came to see him and gathered around his tribunal.
To the same place, according to Josephus, the Jewish
queen Bernice came barefoot and suppliant to ask
favors of Florus.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The act of Pilate in emerging from
the palace to meet the Jews was, therefore, in exact
compliance with Roman custom. His judgment seat
was doubtless raised immediately in front of the entrance
and between the great marble wings of the
palace. Pilate's tribune or <i>bema</i> was located in this
space on the elevated spot called Gabaatha, an Aramaic
word signifying an eminence, a "hump." The
same place in Greek was called Lithostroton, and signified
"The Pavement," because it was laid with
Roman marble mosaic. The location on an eminence
was in accordance with a maxim of Roman law that all
criminal trials should be directed from a raised tribunal
where everybody could see and understand what
was being said and done. The ivory curule chair of
the procurator, or perhaps the ancient golden royal
chair of Archelaus was placed upon the tessellated
pavement and was designed for the use of the governor.
As a general thing, there was sitting room on the tribunal
for the assessors, the accusers and the accused.
But such courtesies and conveniences were not extended
to the despised subjects of Judea; and Jesus, as
well as the members of the Sanhedrin, was compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>to stand. The Latin language was the official tongue
of the Roman empire, and was generally used in the
administration of justice. But at the trial of Jesus it
is believed that the Greek language was the medium
of communication. Jesus had doubtless become acquainted
with Greek in Galilee and probably replied
to Pilate in that tongue. This is the opinion, at
least, of both Keim<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and Geikie.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The former
asserts that there was no interpreter called at the
trial of Christ. It is also reasonably certain that no
special orator like Tertullus, who informed the governor
against Paul, was present to accuse Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Doubtless Caiaphas the high priest played this important
rôle.</p>

<p>When Pilate had mounted the <i>bema</i>, and order had
been restored, he asked:</p>

<p>"What accusation bring ye against this man?"</p>

<p>This question is keenly suggestive of the presence of
a judge and of the beginning of a solemn judicial proceeding.
Every word rings with Roman authority
and administrative capacity. The suggestion is also
prominent that accusation was a more important element
in Roman criminal trials than inquisition. This
suggestion is reënforced by actual <i>dictum</i> from the lips
of Pilate's successor in the same place: "It is not the
manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die,
before that he which is accused have the accusers face
to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning
the crime laid against him."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>The chief priests and scribes sought to evade this
question by answering:</p>

<p>"If he were not a malefactor, we would not have
delivered him up unto thee."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>They meant by this that they desired the procurator
to waive his right to retry the case; accept their trial
as conclusive; and content himself with the mere execution
of the sentence. In this reply of the priests to
the initial question of the Roman judge, is also revealed
the further question of that conflict of jurisdiction
between Jews and Romans that we have already
so fully discussed. "If he were not a malefactor, we
would not have delivered him up unto thee." These
words from the mouths of the priests were intended to
convey to the mind of Pilate the Jewish notion that a
judgment by the Sanhedrin was all-sufficient; and that
they merely needed his countersign to justify execution.
But Pilate did not take the hint or view the
question in that light. In a tone of contemptuous scorn
he simply replied:</p>

<p>"Take ye him, and judge him according to your
law."</p>

<p>This answer indicates that Pilate did not, at first, understand
the exact nature of the proceedings against
Jesus. He evidently did not know that the prisoner
had been charged with a capital offense; else he would
not have suggested that the Jews take jurisdiction of
the matter. This is clearly shown from the further
reply of the priestly accusers:</p>

<p>"It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>The advice of Pilate and the retort of the Jews have
been construed in two ways. A certain class of critics
have contended that the procurator granted to the
Jews in this instance the right to carry out capital
punishment, as others have maintained was the case
in the execution of Stephen. This construction
argues that Pilate knew at once the nature of the
accusation.</p>

<p>Another class of writers contend that the governor,
by this language, merely proposed to them one of the
minor penalties which they were already empowered
to execute. The objection to the first interpretation is
that the Jews would have been delighted to have such
power conferred upon them, and would have exercised
it; unless it is true, as has been held, that they
were desirous of throwing the odium of Christ's death
upon the Romans. The second construction is entirely
admissible, because it is consonant with the theory
that jurisdiction in capital cases had been withdrawn
from the Sanhedrin, but that the trial and punishment
of petty offenses still remained with it. A third and
more reasonable interpretation still is that when Pilate
said, "Take ye him and judge him according to your
law," he intended to give expression to the hatred and
bitterness of his cynical and sarcastic soul. He despised
the Jews most heartily, and he knew that they
hated him. He had repeatedly outraged their religious
feelings by introducing images and shields into
the Holy City. He had devoted the Corban funds to
unhallowed purposes, and had mingled the blood of
the Galileans with their sacrifices. In short, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
left nothing undone to humiliate and degrade them.
Now here was another opportunity. By telling them
to judge Jesus according to their own laws, he knew
that they must make a reply which would be wounding
and galling to their race and national pride. He
knew that they would have to confess that sovereignty
and nationality were gone from them. Such a confession
from them would be music to his ear. The substance
of his advice to the Jews was to exercise their
rights to a certain point, to the moment of condemnation;
but to stop at the place where their sweetest desires
would be gratified with the exercise of the rights
of sovereignty and nationality.</p>

<p>Modern poetry supports this interpretation of ancient
history. "The Merchant of Venice" reveals
the same method of heaping ridicule upon a Jew by
making him impotent to execute the law. Shylock,
the Jew, in contracting a usurious loan, inserted a
stipulation that if the debt should not be paid when
due, the debtor must allow a pound of flesh to be cut
from his body. The debt was not discharged at the
maturity of the bond, and Shylock made application
to the Doge to have the pound of human flesh delivered
to him in accordance with the compact. But Portia,
a friend of the debtor, though a woman, assumed
the garb and affected the speech of a lawyer in his defense;
and, in pleading the case, called tauntingly and
exultingly to the Jew:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words expressly are, a pound of flesh:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span><span class="i0">Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are by the laws of Venice confiscate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the State of Venice.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But whatever special interpretation may be placed
upon the opening words passed between the priestly
accusers and the Roman judge, it is clearly evident that
the latter did not intend to surrender to the former the
right to impose and execute a sentence of death. The
substance of Pilate's address to the Jews, when they
sought to evade his question concerning the accusation
which they had to bring against Jesus, was this: I have
asked for a specific charge against the man whom you
have brought bound to me. You have given not a
direct, but an equivocal answer. I infer that the crime
with which you charge him is one against your own
laws. With such offenses I do not wish to meddle.
Therefore, I say unto you: "Take ye him and judge
him according to your law." If I am not to know the
specific charge against him, I will not assume cognizance
of the case. If the accusation and the facts
relied upon to support it are not placed before me, I
will not sentence the man to death; and, under the law,
you cannot.</p>

<p>The Jews were thus thwarted in their designs. They
had hoped to secure a countersign of their own judgment
without a retrial by the governor. They now
found him in no yielding and accommodating mood.
They were thus forced against their will and expectation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>to formulate specific charges against the prisoner
in their midst. The indictment as they presented it, is
given in a single verse of St. Luke:</p>

<p>"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found
this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to
give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ,
a King."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in this general accusation is a
radical departure from the charges of the night before.
In the passage from the Sanhedrin to the Prætorium,
the indictment had completely changed. Jesus had not
been condemned on any of the charges recorded in this
sentence of St. Luke. He had been convicted on the
charge of blasphemy. But before Pilate he is now
charged with high treason. To meet the emergency
of a change of jurisdiction, the priestly accusers converted
the accusation from a religious into a political
offense. It may be asked why the Sanhedrists did not
maintain the same charges before Pilate that they
themselves had considered before their own tribunal.
Why did they not lead Jesus into the presence of the
Roman magistrate and say: O Governor, we have here
a Galilean blasphemer of Jehovah. We want him
tried on the charge of blasphemy, convicted and sentenced
to death. Why did they not do this? They
were evidently too shrewd. Why? Because, in legal
parlance, they would have had no standing in court.
Why? Because blasphemy was not an offense against
Roman law, and Roman judges would generally assume
cognizance of no such charges.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
The Jews understood perfectly well at the trial
before Pilate the principle of Roman procedure so admirably
expressed a few years later by Gallio, proconsul
of Achaia, and brother of Seneca: "If it were a
matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason
would that I should bear with you: but if it be a question
of words and names, and of your law, look ye to
it; for I will be no judge of such matters."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This attitude
of Roman governors toward offenses of a religious
nature perfectly explains the Jewish change of
front in the matter of the accusation against Jesus.
They merely wanted to get themselves into a Roman
court on charges that a Roman judge would consent to
try. In the threefold accusation recorded by the third
Evangelist, they fully accomplished this result.</p>

<p>The first count in the indictment, that He was perverting
the nation, was vague and indefinite, but was
undoubtedly against Roman law, because it was in the
nature of sedition, which was one of the forms of treason
under Roman jurisprudence. This charge of perverting
the nation was in the nature of the revival of
the accusation of sedition which they had first brought
forward by means of the false witnesses before their
own tribunal, and that had been abandoned because of
the contradictory testimony of these witnesses.</p>

<p>The second count in the indictment, that He had forbidden
to give tribute to Cæsar, was of a more serious
nature than the first. A refusal, in modern times, to
pay taxes or an attempt to obstruct their collection, is
a mild offense compared with a similar act under ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>Roman law. To forbid to pay tribute to Cæsar
in Judea was a form of treason, not only because it was
an open defiance of the laws of the Roman state, but
also because it was a direct denial of Roman sovereignty
in Palestine. Such conduct was treason under
the definitions of both Ulpian and Cicero. The Jews
knew the gravity of the offense when they sought to
entrap Jesus in the matter of paying tribute to Cæsar.
They believed that any answer to the question that they
had asked, would be fatal to Him. If He advised to
pay the imperial tribute, He could be charged with
being an enemy to His countrymen, the Jews. If
He advised not to pay the tribute, He would be
charged with being a rebellious subject of Cæsar. His
reply disconcerted and bewildered them when He
said: "Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which
are Cæsar's; and unto God the things that are God's."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
In this sublime declaration, the Nazarene announced
the immortal principle of the separation of church and
state, and of religious freedom in all the ages. And
when, in the face of His answer, they still charged
Him with forbidding to pay tribute to Cæsar, they
seem to have been guilty of deliberate falsehood.
Keim calls the charge "a very flagrant lie." Both at
Capernaum,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> where Roman taxes were gathered, and
at Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> where religious dues were offered, Jesus
seems to have been both a good citizen and a pious
Jew. "Jésus bon citoyen" (Jesus a good citizen) is
the title of a chapter in the famous work of Bossuet
entitled "Politique tirée de l'Ecriture sainte." In it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>the great French ecclesiastic describes very beautifully
the law-abiding qualities of the citizen-prophet of
Galilee. In pressing the false charge that he had advised
not to pay taxes to Rome, the enemies of Jesus
revealed a peculiar and wanton malignity.</p>

<p>The third count in the indictment, that the prisoner
had claimed to be "Christ a King," was the last and
greatest of the charges. By this He was deliberately
accused of high treason against Cæsar, the gravest
offense known to Roman law. Such an accusation
could not be ignored by Pilate as a loyal deputy of
Tiberius. The Roman monarch saw high treason in
every word and act that was uncomplimentary to his
person or dangerous to his power. Fifty-two prosecutions
for treason, says Tacitus, took place during his
reign.</p>

<p>The charges of high treason and sedition against
Jesus were all the more serious because the Romans
believed Palestine to be the hotbed of insurrection and
sedition, and the birthplace of pretenders to kingly
powers. They had recently had trouble with claimants
to thrones, some of them from the lowest and most
ignoble ranks. Judas, the son of Hezekiah, whom
Herod had caused to be put to death, proclaimed
royal intentions, gathered quite a multitude of adherents
about him in the neighborhood of Sepphoris in
Galilee, raised an insurrection, assaulted and captured
the palace of the king at Sepphoris, seized all the
weapons that were stored away in it, and armed his
followers with them. Josephus does not tell us what
became of this royal pretender; but he does say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
"he became terrible to all men, by tearing and rending
those that came near him."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In the province of Perea, a certain Simon, who was
formerly a slave of Herod, collected a band of followers,
and had himself proclaimed king by them. He
burned down the royal palace at Jericho, after having
plundered it. A detachment under the command of
the Roman general Gratus made short work of the
pretensions of Simon by capturing his adherents and
putting him to death.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Again, a certain peasant named Athronges, formerly
a shepherd, claimed to be a king, and for a long time,
in concert with his four brothers, annoyed the authorities
of the country, until the insurrection was finally
broken up by Gratus and Ptolemy.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>In short, during the life of Jesus, Judea was passing
through a period of great religious and political excitement.
The Messiah was expected and a king was
hoped for; and numerous pretenders appeared from
time to time. The Roman governors were constantly
on the outlook for acts of sedition and treason. And
when the Jews led Jesus into the presence of Pilate
and charged Him with claiming to be a king, the recent
cases of Judas, Simon, and Athronges must have
arisen in his mind, quickened his interest in the pretensions
of the prisoner of the Jews, and must have
awakened his sense of loyalty as Cæsar's representative.
The lowliness of Jesus, being a carpenter, did not
greatly allay his fears; for he must have remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>that Simon was once a slave and that Athronges was
nothing more than a simple shepherd.</p>

<p>When Pilate had heard the accusations of the Jews,
he deliberately arose from his judgment seat, gathered
his toga about him, motioned the mob to stand back,
and beckoned Jesus to follow him into the palace. St.
John alone tells us of this occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>At another time, in the Galilean simplicity and freedom
of His nature, the Prophet of Nazareth had
spoken with a tinge of censure and sarcasm of the rulers
of the Gentiles that lorded it over their subjects,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and had declared that "they that wear soft clothing
are in kings' houses."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Now the lowly Jewish peasant
was entering for the first time a palace of one of the
rulers of the Gentiles in which were soft raiment and
royal purple. The imagination is helpless to picture
the historical reflections born of the memories of that
hour. A meek and lowly carpenter enters a king's palace
on his way to an ignominious death upon the cross;
and yet the greatest kings of all the centuries that followed
were humble worshipers in their palaces before
the cross that had been the instrument of his torture
and degradation. Such is the irony of history; such is
the mystery of God's providence; such is the mystic
ebb and flow of the tides and currents of destiny and
fate.</p>

<p>Of the examination of Jesus inside the palace, little
is known. Pilate, it seems, brushed the first two
charges aside as unworthy of serious consideration;
and proceeded at once to examine the prisoner on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>charge that he pretended to be a king. "If," Pilate
must have said, "the fellow pretends to be a king, as
Simon and Athronges did before him; if he says that
Judea has a right to have a king other than Cæsar, he
is guilty of treason, and it is my solemn duty as deputy
of Tiberius to ascertain the fact and have him put to
death."</p>

<p>The beginning of the interrogation of Jesus within
the palace is reported by all the Evangelists in the same
words. Addressing the prisoner, Pilate asked: "Art
thou the King of the Jews?" "Jesus answered him,
Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it
thee of me?"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>This was a most natural and fitting response of the
Nazarene to the Roman. It was necessary first to
understand the exact nature of the question before an
appropriate answer could be made. Jesus simply
wished to know whether the question was asked from
a Roman or a Jewish, from a temporal or a spiritual
standpoint. If the interrogation was directed from a
Roman, a temporal point of view, His answer would
be an emphatic negative. If the inquiry had been
prompted by the Jews, it was then pregnant with religious
meaning, and called for a different reply; one
that would at once repudiate pretensions to earthly
royalty, and, at the same time, assert His claims to the
Messiahship and heavenly sovereignty.</p>

<p>"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation
and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me:
What hast thou done?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
To this Jesus replied: "My kingdom is not of this
world: if my kingdom were of this world, then
would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from
hence."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>This reply of the Master is couched in that involved,
aphoristic, strangely beautiful style that characterized
His speech at critical moments in His career. Its import
is clear, though expressed in a double sense: first
from the Roman political, and then from the Jewish
religious side.</p>

<p>First He answered negatively: "My kingdom is not
of this world."</p>

<p>By this He meant that there was no possible rivalry
between Him and Cæsar. But, in making this denial,
He had used two words of grave import: My Kingdom.
He had used one word that struck the ear of
Pilate with electric force: the word Kingdom. In the
use of that word, according to Pilate's reasoning, Jesus
stood self-convicted. For how, thought Pilate, can He
pretend to have a Kingdom, unless He pretends to be
a king? And then, as if to cow and intimidate the
prisoner, as if to avoid an unpleasant issue of the affair,
he probably advanced threateningly upon the Christ,
and asked the question which the Bible puts in his
mouth: "Art thou a king then?"</p>

<p>Rising from the simple dignity of a man to the
beauty and glory and grandeur of a God, Jesus used
the most wonderful, beautiful, meaningful words in
the literature of the earth: "Thou sayest that I am a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came
I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the
truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my
voice."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>This language contains a perfectly clear description
of the kingdom of Christ and of His title to spiritual
sovereignty. His was not an empire of matter,
but a realm of truth. His kingdom differed widely
from that of Cæsar. Cæsar's empire was over the
bodies of men; Christ's over their souls. The strength
of Cæsar's kingdom was in citadels, armies, navies, the
towering Alps, the all-engirdling seas. The strength
of the kingdom of the Christ was and is and will ever
be in sentiments, principles, ideas, and the saving
power of a divine word. But, as clever and brilliant
as he must have been, Pilate could not grasp the true
meaning of the words of the Prophet. The spiritual
and intellectual grandeur of the Galilean peasant was
beyond the reach of the Roman lord and governor. In
a cynical and sarcastic mood, Pilate turned to Jesus
and asked: "What is truth?"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>This pointed question was the legitimate offspring
of the soul of Pilate and a natural product of the
Roman civilization of his age. It was not asked with
any real desire to know the truth; for he turned to
leave the palace before an answer could be given. It
was simply a blank response born of mental wretchedness
and doubt. If prompted by any silent yearning
for a knowledge of the truth, his conduct indicated
clearly that he did not hope to have that longing satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>by the words of the humble prisoner in his charge.
"What is truth?" An instinctive utterance this,
prompted by previous sad reflections upon the wrecks
of philosophy in search of truth.</p>

<p>We have reason to believe that Pilate was a man of
brilliant parts and studious habits. His marriage into
the Roman royal family argued not only splendid
physical endowments, but rare intellectual gifts as
well. Only on this hypothesis can we explain his rise
from obscurity in Spain to a place in the royal family
as husband of the granddaughter of Augustus and
foster daughter of Tiberius. Then he was familiar, if
he was thus endowed and accomplished, with the despairing
efforts of his age and country to solve the
mysteries of life and to ascertain the end of man. He
had doubtless, as a student, "mused and mourned over
Greece, and its search of truth intellectual&mdash;its keen
and fruitless search, never-ending, ever beginning,
across wastes of doubt and seas of speculation lighted
by uncertain stars." He knew full well that Roman
philosophy had been wrecked and stranded amidst the
floating débris of Grecian thought and speculation.
He had thought that the <i>ultima ratio</i> of Academicians
and Peripatetics, of Stoics and Epicureans had been
reached. But here was a new proposition&mdash;a kingdom
of truth whose sovereign had as subjects mere vagaries,
simple mental conceptions called truths&mdash;a kingdom
whose boundaries were not mountains, seas, and rivers,
but clouds, hopes, and dreams.</p>

<p>What did Pilate think of Jesus? He evidently regarded
Him as an amiable enthusiast, a harmless religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
fanatic from whom Cæsar had nothing to fear.
While alone with Jesus in the palace, he must have
reasoned thus with himself, silently and contemptuously:
The mob outside tells me that this man is
Rome's enemy. Foolish thought! We know who
Cæsar's enemies are. We have seen and heard and
felt the enemies of Rome&mdash;barbarians from beyond the
Danube and the Rhine&mdash;great strong men, who can
drive a javelin not only through a man, but a horse, as
well. These are Cæsar's enemies. This strange and
melancholy man, whose subjects are mere abstract
truths, and whose kingdom is beyond the skies, can be
no enemy of Cæsar.</p>

<p>Believing this, he went out to the rabble and pronounced
a verdict of acquittal: "I find in him no fault
at all."</p>

<p>Pilate had tried and acquitted Jesus. Why did he
not release Him, and, if need be, protect Him with his
cohort from the assaults of the Jews? Mankind has
asked for nearly two thousand years why a Roman,
with the blood of a Roman in him, with the glorious
prestige and stern authority of the Roman empire at
his back, with a Roman legion at his command, did
not have the courage to do the high Roman act. Pilate
was a moral and intellectual coward of arrant type.
This is his proper characterization and a fitting answer
to the world's eternal question.</p>

<p>The Jews heard his sentence of acquittal in sullen
silence. Desperately resolved to prevent His release,
they began at once to frame new accusations.</p>

<p>"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning
from Galilee to this place."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>This charge was intended by the Jews to serve a
double purpose: to strengthen the general accusation
of high treason recorded by St. Luke; and to embitter
and poison the mind of the judge against the prisoner
by telling Pilate that Jesus was from Galilee. In ancient
times Galilee was noted as the hotbed of riot and
sedition. The Galileans were brave and hardy mountaineers
who feared neither Rome nor Judea. As
champions of Jewish nationality, they were the fiercest
opponents of Roman rule; and in the final catastrophe
of Jewish history they were the last to be driven from
the battlements of Jerusalem. As advocates and preservers
of the purity of the primitive Jewish faith, they
were relentless foes of Pharisaic and Sadducean hypocrisy
as it was manifested by the Judean keepers of the
Temple. The Galileans were hated, therefore, by both
Romans and Judeans; and the Sanhedrists believed
that Pilate would make short work of Jesus if he
learned that the prisoner was from Galilee. But a different
train of thought was excited in the mind of the
Roman governor. He was thinking about one thing,
and they about another. Pilate showed himself
throughout the trial a craven coward and contemptible
timeserver. From beginning to end, his conduct was
a record of cowardice and subterfuge. He was constantly
looking for loopholes of escape. His heart's
desire was to satisfy at once both his conscience and the
mob. The mention of Galilee was a ray of light that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>fell across the troubled path of the cowardly and vacillating
judge. He believed that he saw an avenue of
escape. He asked the Jews if Jesus was a Galilean.
An affirmative reply was given. Pilate then determined
to rid himself of responsibility by sending
Jesus to be tried by the governor of the province to
which He belonged. He felt that fortune favored
his design; for Herod, Tetrarch of Galilee, was at that
very moment in Jerusalem in attendance upon the
Passover feast. He acted at once upon the happy idea;
and, under the escort of a detachment of the Prætorian
Cohort, Jesus was led away to the palace of the Maccabees
where Herod was accustomed to stop when he
came to the Holy City.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>JESUS BEFORE HEROD</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_i-ch09.jpg" width="100" height="111" alt="I" title="I"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">I</span>T was still early morning when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Jesus, guarded by Roman soldiers
and surrounded by a jeering,
scoffing, raging multitude
of Jews, was conducted to the
palace of the Maccabees on the
slope of Zion, the official residence
of Herod when he came to
Jerusalem to attend the sacred
festivals. This place was to the northeast of the palace
of Herod and only a few streets distant from it.
The journey must have lasted therefore only a few
minutes.</p>

<p>But who was this Herod before whom Jesus now appeared
in chains? History mentions many Herods,
the greatest and meanest of whom was Herod I, surnamed
the Great, who ordered the massacre of the Innocents
at Bethlehem. At his death, he bequeathed his
kingdom to his sons. But being a client-prince, a <i>rex
socius</i>, he could not finally dispose of his realm without
the consent of Rome. Herod had made several wills,
and, at his death, contests arose between his sons for
the vacant throne of the father. Several embassies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
were sent to Rome to argue the rights of the different
claimants. Augustus granted the petitioners many
audiences; and, after long delay, finally confirmed
practically the last will of Herod. This decision gave
Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, with a tribute of six hundred
talents, to Archelaus. Philip received the regions
of Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Trachonitis, Batanea, and
Iturea, with an income of one hundred talents. Herod
Antipas was given the provinces of Galilee and Perea,
with an annual tribute of two hundred talents and the
title of Tetrarch. The title of Ethnarch was conferred
upon Archelaus.</p>

<p>Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee, was the man
before whom Jesus, his subject, was now led to be
judged. The pages of sacred history mention the name
of no more shallow and contemptible character than
this petty princeling, this dissolute Idumæan Sadducee.
Compared with him, Judas is eminently respectable.
Judas had a conscience which, when smitten
with remorse, drove him to suicide. It is doubtful
whether Herod had a spark of that celestial fire which
we call conscience. He was a typical Oriental prince
whose chief aim in life was the gratification of his passions.
The worthlessness of his character was so pronounced
that it excited a nauseating disgust in the
mind of Jesus, and disturbed for a moment that serene
and lofty magnanimity which characterized His whole
life and conduct. To Herod is addressed the only
purely contemptuous epithet that the Master is ever
recorded to have used. "And he said unto them, Go
ye, and tell <i>that fox</i>, Behold, I cast out devils, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I
shall be perfected."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The son of a father who was ten times married and
had murdered many of his wives; the murderer himself
of John the Baptist; the slave of a lewd and
wicked woman&mdash;what better could be expected than a
cruel, crafty, worthless character, whose attributes
were those of the fox?</p>

<p>But why was Jesus sent to Herod? Doubtless because
Pilate wished to shift the responsibility from his
own shoulders, as a Roman judge, to those of the Galilean
Tetrarch. A subsidiary purpose may have been
to conciliate Herod, with whom, history says, he had
had a quarrel. The cause of the trouble between them
is not known. Many believe that the murder of the
Galileans while sacrificing in the Temple was the origin
of the unpleasantness. Others contend that this
occurrence was the result and not the cause of the quarrel
between Pilate and Herod. Still others believe
that the question of the occupancy of the magnificent
palace of Herod engendered ill feeling between the
rival potentates. Herod had all the love of gorgeous
architecture and luxurious living that characterized
the whole Herodian family. And, besides, he doubtless
felt that he should be permitted to occupy the palace
of his ancestors on the occasion of his visits to Jerusalem.
But Pilate would naturally object to this, as he
was the representative of almighty Rome in a conquered
province and could not afford to give way, in
a matter of palatial residence, to a petty local prince.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>But, whatever the cause, the unfriendliness between
them undoubtedly had much to do with the transfer
of Jesus from the Prætorium to the palace of the
Maccabees.</p>

<p>"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding
glad: for he was desirous to see him for a long season,
because he had heard many things of him; and he
hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>This passage of Scripture throws much light upon
Herod's opinion and estimate of Jesus. Fearing that
he was the successor and imitator of Judas the Gaulonite,
Herod at first sought to drive Him from his province
by sending spies to warn Him to flee. The courageous
and contemptuous reply of Jesus, in which he
styled Herod "that fox," put an end to further attempts
at intimidation.</p>

<p>The notions of the Galilean Tetrarch concerning the
Galilean Prophet seem to have changed from time to
time. Herod had once regarded Jesus with feelings
of superstitious dread and awe, as the risen Baptist.
But these apprehensions had now partially passed
away, and he had come to look upon the Christ as a
clever impostor whose claims to kingship and Messiahship
were mere vulgar dreams. For three years, Galilee
had been ringing with the fame of the Miracle-worker;
but Herod had never seen his famous subject.
Now was his chance. And he anticipated a rare
occasion of magic and merriment. He doubtless regarded
Jesus as a clever magician whose performance
would make a rich and racy programme for an hour's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>amusement of his court. This was no doubt his dominant
feeling regarding the Nazarene. But it is nevertheless
very probable that his Idumæan cowardice
and superstition still conjured images of a drunken
debauch, the dance of death, and the bloody head;
and connected them with the strange man now before
him.</p>

<p>No doubt he felt highly pleased and gratified to
have Jesus sent to him. The petty and obsequious vassal
king was caught in Pilate's snare of flattery. The
sending of a noted prisoner to his judgment seat by a
Roman procurator was no ordinary compliment. But
Herod was at once too serious and too frivolous to assume
jurisdiction of any charges against this prisoner,
who had offended both the religious and secular powers
of Palestine. To condemn Jesus would be to incur
the ill will and resentment of his many followers in his
own province of Galilee. Besides, he had already suffered
keenly from dread and apprehension, caused by
the association of the names of John and Jesus, and he
had learned that from the blood of one murdered
prophet would spring the message and mission of another
still more powerful and majestic. He was,
therefore, unwilling to embroil himself and his dominions
with the heavenly powers by condemning their
earthly representatives.</p>

<p>Again, though weak, crafty and vacillating, he still
had enough of the cunning of the fox not to wish to
excite the enmity of Cæsar by a false judgment upon
a noted character whose devoted followers might, at
any moment, send an embassy to Rome to make serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and successful charges to the Emperor. He afterwards
lost his place as Tetrarch through the suspicions
of Caligula, who received news from Galilee that
Herod was conspiring against him.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The premonitions
of that unhappy day probably now filled the
mind of the Idumæan.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Herod was too frivolous to conduct
from beginning to end a solemn judicial proceeding.
He evidently intended to ignore the pretensions
of Jesus, and to convert the occasion of His coming
into a festive hour in which languor and drowsiness
would be banished from his court. He had heard
much of the miracles of the prisoner in his presence.
Rumor had wafted to his ears strange accounts of marvelous
feats. One messenger had brought news that
the Prophet of Nazareth had raised from the dead a
man named Lazarus from Bethany, and also the son of
the widow of Nain. Another had declared that the
laws of nature suspended themselves on occasion at
His behest; that when He walked out on the sea, He
did not sink; and that He stilled the tempests with a
mere motion of His hand. Still another reported that
the mighty magician could take mud from the pool
and restore sight; that a woman, ill for many months,
need only touch the hem of His garment to be made
whole again; and that if He but touched the flesh of a
leper, it would become as tender and beautiful as that
of a new-born babe. These reports had doubtless been
received by Herod with sneers and mocking. But he
gathered from them that Jesus was a clever juggler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>whose powers of entertainment were very fine; and this
was sufficient for him and his court.</p>

<p>"Then he questioned with him in many words; but
he answered him nothing."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Herod thus opened the examination of Jesus by interrogating
Him at length. The Master treated his
insolent questions with contemptuous scorn and withering
silence. No doubt this conduct of the lowly
Nazarene greatly surprised and nettled the supercilious
Idumæan. He had imagined that Jesus would
be delighted to give an exhibition of His skill amidst
royal surroundings. He could not conceive that a
peasant would observe the contempt of silence in the
presence of a prince. He found it difficult, therefore,
to explain this silence. He probably mistook it for stupidity,
and construed it to mean that the pretensions of
Jesus were fraudulent. He doubtless believed that his
captive would not work a miracle because He could
not; and that in His failure to do so were exploded
His claims to kingship and Messiahship. At all
events, he was evidently deeply perplexed; and this
perplexity of the Tetrarch, in its turn, only served to
anger the accusing priests who stood by.</p>

<p>"And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently
accused him."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>This verse from St. Luke clearly reveals the difference
in the temper and purposes of the Sanhedrists on
the one hand, and of Herod on the other. The latter
merely intended to make of the case of Jesus a farcical
proceeding in which the jugglery of the prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>would break the monotony of a day and banish all care
during an idle hour. The priests, on the other hand,
were desperately bent upon a serious outcome of the
affair, as the words "vehemently accused" suggest.
In the face of their repeated accusations, Jesus continued
to maintain a noble and majestic silence.</p>

<p>Modern criticism has sought to analyze and to explain
the behavior of Christ at the court of Herod.
"How comes it," asks Strauss, "that Jesus, not only the
Jesus without sin of the orthodox school, but also the
Jesus who bowed to the constituted authorities, who
says 'Give unto Cæsar that which is Cæsar's'&mdash;how
comes it that he refuses the answer due to Herod?"
The trouble with this question is that it falsely assumes
that there was an "answer due to Herod." In the first
place, it must be considered that Herod was not Cæsar.
In the next place, we must remember that St. Luke,
the sole Evangelist who records the event, does not
explain the character of the questions asked by Herod.
Strauss himself says that they "displayed simple curiosity."
Admitting that Jesus acknowledged the jurisdiction
of Herod, was He compelled to answer irrelevant
and impertinent questions? We do not know
what these questions were. But we have reason to
believe that, coming from Herod, they were not such
as Jesus was called upon to answer. It is very probable
that the prisoner knew His legal rights; and that
He did not believe that Herod, sitting at Jerusalem, a
place without his province, was judicially empowered
to examine Him. If He was not legally compelled to
answer, we are not surprised that Jesus refused to do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
as a matter of graciousness and accommodation; for
we must not forget that the Man-God felt that He was
being questioned by a vulgar animal of the most cunning
type.</p>

<p>But what is certain from the Scriptural context is
that Herod felt chagrined and mortified at his failure
to evoke from Jesus any response. He was enraged
that his plans had been foiled by one of his own subjects,
a simple Galilean peasant. To show his resentment,
he then resorted to mockery and abuse.</p>

<p>"And Herod with his men of war set him at nought,
and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe,
and sent him again to Pilate."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>We are not informed by St. Luke what special
charge the priests brought against Jesus at the judgment
seat of Herod. He simply says that they "stood
and vehemently accused him." But we are justified in
inferring that they repeated substantially the same accusations
which had been made before Pilate, that He
had claimed to be Christ a King. This conclusion best
explains the mockery which they sought to heap upon
Him; for in ancient times, when men became candidates
for office, they put on white gowns to notify the
people of their candidacy. Again, Tacitus assures us
that white garments were the peculiar dress of illustrious
persons; and that the tribunes and consuls wore
them when marching before the eagles of the legions
into battle.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The meaning of the mockery of Herod was simply
this: Behold O Pilate, the illustrious candidate for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>kingship of the Jews! Behold the imperial gown of
the royal peasant pretender!</p>

<p>The appearance before Herod resulted only in the
humiliation of Jesus and the reconciliation of Pilate
and Herod.</p>

<p>"And the same day Pilate and Herod were made
friends together: for before they were at enmity
between themselves."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>JESUS AGAIN BEFORE PILATE</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_t-ch01.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="T" title="T"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE sending of Jesus to Herod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
had not ended the case; and
Pilate was undoubtedly very bitterly
disappointed. He had
hoped that the Galilean Tetrarch
would assume complete
jurisdiction and dispose finally
of the matter. On the contrary,
Herod simply mocked and brutalized
the prisoner and had him sent back to Pilate.
The Roman construed the action of the Idumæan to
mean an acquittal, and he so stated to the Jews.</p>

<p>"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief
priests and the rulers and the people, Said unto them,
Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth
the people: and, behold, I, having examined
him before you, have found no fault in this man touching
those things whereof ye accuse him: No, nor yet
Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy
of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise
him, and release him."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The proposal to scourge the prisoner was the second
of those criminal and cowardly subterfuges through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>which Pilate sought at once to satisfy his conscience
and the demands of the mob. The chastisement was to
be a sop to the rage of the rabble, a sort of salve to the
wounded pride of the priests who were disappointed
that no sentence of death had been imposed. The release
was intended as a tribute to justice, as a soothing
balm and an atoning sacrifice to his own outraged
sense of justice. The injustice of this monstrous proposal
was not merely contemptible, it was execrable.
If Jesus was guilty, He should have been punished; if
innocent, he should have been set free and protected
from the assaults of the Jews.</p>

<p>The offer of scourging first and then the release of
the prisoner was indignantly rejected by the rabble.
In his desperation, Pilate thought of another loophole
of escape.</p>

<p>The Evangelists tell us that it was a custom upon
Passover day to release to the people any single prisoner
that they desired. St. Luke asserts that the governor
was under an obligation to do so.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Whether this
custom was of Roman or Hebrew origin is not certainly
known. Many New Testament interpreters
have seen in the custom a symbol of the liberty and
deliverance realized by Israel in its passage from
Egypt at the time of the first great Passover. Others
have traced this custom to the Roman practice of releasing
a slave at the Lectisternia, or banquets to the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Aside from its origin, it is interesting as an
illustration of a universal principle in enlightened
jurisprudence of lodging somewhere, usually with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>chief executive of a race or nation, a power of pardon
which serves as an extinction of the penal sanction.
This merciful principle is a pathetic acknowledgment
of the weakness and imperfection of all human schemes
of justice.</p>

<p>Pilate resolved to escape from his confusion and
embarrassment by delivering Jesus to the people, who
happened to appear in great numbers at the very
moment when Christ returned from Herod. The multitude
had come to demand the usual Passover deliverance
of a prisoner. The arrival of the crowd of disinterested
strangers was inopportune for the priests
and elders who were clamoring for the life of the prisoner
in their midst. They marked with keen discernment
the resolution of the governor to release Jesus.
They were equal to the emergency, and began to whisper
among the crowd that Barabbas should be asked.</p>

<p>"And they had then a notable prisoner, called
Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together,
Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I
release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called
Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered
him."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Pilate believed that the newly arrived multitude
would be free from the envy of the priests, and that
they would be satisfied with Jesus whom they had, a
few days before, welcomed into Jerusalem with shouts
of joy. When they demanded Barabbas, he still believed
that if he offered them the alternative choice of
a robber and a prophet, they would choose the latter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude
that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy
Jesus. The governor answered and said unto them,
Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you?
They said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What
shall I do then with Jesus which is called the Christ?
They all say unto him, Let him be crucified."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>"Barabbas, or Jesus which is called the Christ?"
Such was the alternative offered by a Roman governor
to a Jewish mob. Barabbas was a murderer and a robber.
Jesus was the sinless Son of God. An erring race
wandering in the darkness of sin and perpetually tasting
the bitterness of life beneath the sun, preferred a
criminal to a prophet. And to the ghastliness of the
choice was added a touch of the irony of fate. The
names of both the prisoners were in signification the
same. Barabbas was also called Jesus. And Jesus
Barabbas meant Jesus the Son of the Father. This
frightful coincidence was so repugnant to the Gospel
writers that they are generally silent upon it. In this
connection, Strauss remarks: "According to one reading,
the man's complete name was <span lang="el" title="Greek: hiêsous barabbas">&#7985;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#962;</span>,
which fact is noted only because Olshausen considers it
noteworthy. Barabbas signifies 'son of the father,' and
consequently Olshausen exclaims: 'All that was essential
to the Redeemer appears ridiculous in the assassin!'
and he deems applicable the verse: '<i>Ludit in
humanis divina potentia rebus.</i>' We can see nothing
in Olshausen's remark but a <i>ludus humanæ impotentiæ</i>."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>Amidst the tumult provoked by the angry passions
of the mob, a messenger arrived from his wife bearing
news that filled the soul of Pilate with superstitious
dread. Claudia had had a dream of strange and ill-boding
character.</p>

<p>"When he was set down on the judgment seat, his
wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do
with that just man: For I have suffered many things
this day in a dream because of him."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>This dream of Pilate's wife is nothing strange.
Profane history mentions many similar ones. Calpurnia,
Cæsar's wife, forewarned him in a dream not to
go to the senate house; and the greatest of the Romans
fell beneath the daggers of Casca and Brutus, because
he failed to heed the admonition of his wife.</p>

<p>In the apocryphal report of Pilate to the emperor
Tiberius of the facts of the crucifixion, the words of
warning sent by Claudia are given: "Beware said she
to me, beware and touch not that man, for he is holy.
Last night I saw him in a vision. He was walking on
the waters. He was flying on the wings of the winds.
He spoke to the tempest and to the fishes of the lake;
all were obedient to him. Behold! the torrent in
Mount Kedron flows with blood, the statues of Cæsar
are filled with the filth of Gemoniæ, the columns of the
Interium have given away and the sun is veiled in
mourning like a vestal in the tomb. O, Pilate, evil
awaits thee if thou wilt not listen to the prayer of thy
wife. Dread the curse of the Roman Senate, dread the
powers of Cæsar."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
This noble and lofty language, this tender and pathetic
speech, may appear strange to those who remember
the hereditary stigma of the woman. If this dream
was sent from heaven, the recollection is forced upon
us that the medium of its communication was the illegitimate
child of a lewd woman. But then her character
was probably not worse than that of Mary Magdalene,
who was very dear to the Master and has been
canonized not only by the church, but by the reverence
of the world.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that the dream of Claudia had
no determining effect upon the conduct of Pilate.
Resolution and irresolution alternately controlled him.
Fear and superstition were uppermost in both mind
and heart. The Jews beheld with anxious and discerning
glance the manifestation of the deep anguish of his
soul. They feared that the governor was about to pronounce
a final judgment of acquittal. Exhibiting
fierce faces and frenzied feelings, they moved closer
to him and exclaimed: "We have a law, and by our
law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son
of God."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Despairing of convicting Jesus on a political charge,
they deliberately revived a religious one, and presented
to Pilate substantially the same accusation upon
which they had tried the prisoner before their own
tribunal.</p>

<p>"He made himself the Son of God!" These words
filled Pilate's mind with a strange and awful meaning.
In the mythology and ancient annals of his race, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>were many legends of the sons of the gods who walked
the earth in human form and guise. They were thus
indistinguishable from mortal men. It was dangerous
to meet them; for to offend them was to provoke the
wrath of the gods, their sires. These reflections, born
of superstition, now swept through Pilate's mind with
terrific force; and the cries of the mob, "He made
himself the Son of God," called from out the deep recesses
of his memory the half-forgotten, half-remembered
stories of his childhood. Could not Jesus, reasoned
Pilate, be the son of the Hebrew Jehovah as
Hercules was the son of Jupiter? Filled with superstitious
dread and trembling with emotion, Pilate
called Jesus inside the Temple a second time; and,
looking with renewed awe and wonder, asked:
"Whence art thou?"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But Jesus answered him
nothing.</p>

<p>Pilate came forth from the judgment hall a second
time determined to release the prisoner; but the Jews,
marking his decision, began to cry out: "Away with
him, away with him, crucify him!"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Maddened by
the relentless importunity of the mob, Pilate replied
scornfully and mockingly:</p>

<p>"Shall I crucify your king?"</p>

<p>The cringing, hypocritical priests shouted back their
answer:</p>

<p>"We have no king but Cæsar."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>And on the kingly idea of loyalty to Roman sovereignty
they framed their last menace and accusation.
From the quiver of their wrath they drew the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>arrow of spite and hate, and fired it straight at the
heart of Jesus through the hands of Pilate:</p>

<p>"If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's
friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh
against Cæsar."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>This last maneuver of the mob sealed the doom of
the Christ. It teaches also most clearly that Pilate was
no match for the Jews when their religious prejudices
were aroused and they were bent on accomplishing
their desires. They knew Pilate and he knew them.
They had been together full six years. He had been
compelled to yield to them in the matter of the standards
and the eagles. The sacred Corban funds had
been appropriated only after blood had been shed in
the streets of Jerusalem. The gilt shields of Tiberius
that he had placed in Herod's palace were taken down
at the demands of the Jews and carried to the temple
of Augustus at Cæsarea. And now the same fanatical
rabble was before him demanding the blood of the
Nazarene, and threatening to accuse him to Cæsar if
he released the prisoner. The position of Pilate was
painfully critical. He afterwards lost his procuratorship
at the instance of accusing Jews. The shadow of
that distant day now fell like a curse across his pathway.
Nothing was so terrifying to a Roman governor
as to have the people send a complaining embassy to
Rome. It was especially dangerous at this time. The
imperial throne was filled by a morbid and suspicious
tyrant who needed but a pretext to depose the governor
of any province who silently acquiesced in traitorous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>pretensions to kingship. Pilate trembled at these reflections.
His feelings of self-preservation suggested
immediate surrender to the Jews. But his innate sense
of justice, which was woven in the very fiber of his
Roman nature, recoiled at the thought of Roman sanction
of judicial murder. He resolved, therefore, to
propitiate and temporize. The frenzied rabble continued
to cry: "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Three
times, in reply, Conscience sent to Pilate's trembling
lips the searching question: "Why, what evil hath he
done?" "Crucify him! Crucify him!" came back
from the infuriated mob.</p>

<p>Pilate finally resolved to do their bidding and obey
their will. But he seems to have secretly cherished the
hope that scourging, which was the usual preliminary
to crucifixion, might be made to satisfy the mob. But
this hope was soon dispelled; and he found himself
compelled to yield completely to their wishes by delivering
the prisoner to be crucified. Before this final
step, however, which was an insult to the true courage
of the soul and an outrage upon all the charities of the
heart, he resolved to apply a soothing salve to wounded
conscience. He resolved to perform a ceremonial
cleansing act. Calling for a basin of water, he washed
his hands before the multitude, saying: "I am innocent
of the blood of this just person: see ye to it."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>This was a simple, impressive, theatrical act; but
little, mean, contemptible, cowardly. He washed his
hands when he should have used them. He should
have used them as Brutus or Gracchus or Pompeius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>Magnus would have done, in pointing his legion to the
field of duty and of glory. He should have used them
as Bonaparte did when he put down the mob in the
streets of Paris. But he was too craven and cowardly;
and herein is to be found the true meaning of the character
and conduct of Pilate. He believed that Jesus
was innocent; and that the accusations against Him
were inspired by the envy of His countrymen. He had
declared to the Jews in an emphatic verdict of acquittal
that he found in Him no fault at all. And yet this
very sentence, "I find in him no fault at all," was the
beginning of that course of cowardly and criminal
vacillation which finally sent Jesus to the cross. "Yet
was this utterance," says Innes, "as it turned out, only
the first step in that downward course of weakness the
world knows so well: a course which, beginning with
indecision and complaisance, passed through all the
phases of alternate bluster and subserviency; persuasion,
evasion, protest, and compromise; superstitious
dread, conscientious reluctance, cautious duplicity, and
sheer moral cowardice at last; until this Roman remains
photographed forever as the perfect feature of
the unjust judge, deciding 'against his better knowledge,
not deceived.'"</p>

<p>"Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when
he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into
the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole
band of soldiers. And they stripped him, and put on
him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a
crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
in his right hand: And they bowed the knee before
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote
him on the head. And after that they had mocked
him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own
raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended the most memorable act of injustice recorded
in history. At every stage of the trial, whether
before Caiaphas or Pilate, the prisoner conducted
Himself with that commanding dignity and majesty so
well worthy of His origin, mission, and destiny. His
sublime deportment at times caused His judges to
marvel greatly. And through it all, He stood alone.
His friends and followers had deserted Him in His
hour of greatest need. Single-handed and unaided,
the Galilean peasant had bared His breast and brow
to the combined authority, to the insults and outrages,
of both Jerusalem and Rome. "Not a single discordant
voice was raised amidst the tumultuous clamour:
not a word of protest disturbed the mighty concord of
anger and reviling; not the faintest echo of the late
hosannas, which had wrung with wonder, fervour, and
devotion, and which had surrounded and exalted to the
highest pitch of triumph the bearer of good tidings on
his entry into the Holy City. Where were the throngs
of the hopeful and believing, who had followed His
beckoning as a finger pointing toward the breaking
dawn of truth and regeneration? Where were they,
what thinking and why silent? The bands at the humble
and poor, of the afflicted and outcast who had entrusted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>to His controlling grace the salvation of soul
and body&mdash;where were they, what thinking and why
silent? The troops of women and youths, who had
drawn fresh strength from the spell of a glance or a
word from the Father of all that liveth&mdash;where were
they, what thinking and why silent? And the multitudes
of disciples and enthusiasts who had scattered
sweet-scented boughs and joyous utterances along the
road to Sion, blessing Him that came in the name of
the Lord&mdash;where were they, what thinking and why
silent? Not a remembrance, not a sign, not a word of
the great glory so lately His. Jesus was alone."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>LEGAL ANALYSIS AND SUMMARY OF THE ROMAN TRIAL
OF JESUS</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_i-ch09.jpg" width="100" height="111" alt="I" title="I"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">I</span>N the preceding pages of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
volume we have considered the
elements of both Law and Fact
as related to the Roman trial of
Jesus. Involved in this consideration
were the powers and duties
of Pilate as procurator of
Judea and as presiding judge at
the trial; general principles of
Roman provincial administration at the time of Christ;
the legal and political status of the subject Jew in his
relationship to the conquering Roman; the exact requirements
of criminal procedure in Roman capital
trials at Rome and in the provinces at the date of the
crucifixion; the Roman law applicable to the trial of
Jesus; and the facts of said trial before Pilate and
Herod.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to analyze the case from
the view point of the juristic agreement or nonagreement
of Law and Fact; and to determine by a process
of judicial dissection and re-formation, the presence or
absence of essential legal elements in the proceedings.
We have learned what should have been done by Pilate
acting as a Roman judge in a criminal matter involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the life of a prisoner. We have also ascertained
what he actually did. We are thus enabled to compare
the requirements with the actualities of the case;
and to ascertain the resemblances in the proceedings
against Jesus to a legally conducted trial under Roman
law.</p>

<p>But, in making this summary and analysis, a most
important consideration must be constantly held in
mind: that, in matters of review on appeal, errors will
not be presumed; that is, errors will not be considered
that do not appear affirmatively upon the record. The
law will rather presume and the court will assume that
what should have been done, was done. In conformity
with this principle, the presumption must be indulged
that Pilate acted in strict obedience to the requirements
of Roman law in trying Jesus, unless the Gospels
of the New Testament, which constitute the record in
the case, either affirmatively or by reasonable inference,
disclose the absence of such obedience. A failure
to note this presumption and to keep this principle in
mind, has caused many writers upon this subject to
make erroneous statements concerning the merits and
legal aspects of the trial of Christ.</p>

<p>Laymen frequently assert the essential principle of
this presumption without seeming to be aware of it.
Both Keim and Geikie declare that assessors or assistants
were associated with Pilate in the trial of Jesus.
The Gospel records nowhere even intimate such a
thing; and no other original records are in existence to
furnish such information. And yet one of the most
celebrated of the biblical critics, Dr. Theodor Keim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
writing on the trial of Christ by Pilate, says: "Beside
him, upon benches, were the council or the assessors of
the court, sub-officials, friends, Roman citizens, whose
presence could not be dispensed with, and who were
not wanting to the procurators of Judea, although our
reports do not mention them."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> To the same effect,
Dr. Cunningham Geikie thus writes: "The assessors
of the court&mdash;Roman citizens&mdash;who acted as nominal
members of the judicial bench, sit beside Pilate&mdash;for
Roman law required their presence."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>These statements of the renowned writers just
quoted are justified not only on the ground of logical
historical inference, but also on the principle of actual
legal presumption. The closest scrutiny of the New
Testament narratives nowhere discovers even an intimation
that a bench of judges helped Pilate to conduct
the trial of Jesus. And yet, as Geikie says, "Roman
law required their presence," and the legal presumption
is that they were in and about the Prætorium
ready to lend assistance, and that they actually took
part in the proceedings. This inference is strengthened
by the fact that Pilate, after he had learned the
nature of the accusation against Jesus, called Him into
the palace to examine Him. Why did Pilate do this?
Why did he not examine the prisoner in the presence
of His accusers in the open air? Geikie tells us that
there was a judgment hall in the palace in which trials
were usually conducted.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Is it not possible, nay probable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>that the assessors and Pilate were assembled at an
early hour in this hall to hear the usual criminal
charges of the day, or, perhaps, to try the accusation
against Jesus, of whose appearance before them they
had been previously notified; and that, when the governor
heard that the religious scruples of the Jews
would not permit them to enter the judgment hall during
the Passover feast, he went out alone to hear the
accusation against the prisoner; and that he then returned
with the accused into the hall where the bench
of judges were awaiting him, to lay before them the
charges and to further examine the case? It is admitted
that this theory and the statement of Geikie that
there was a hall in the palace where trials were generally
held, are seemingly refuted by the fact that Roman
trials were almost always conducted in the open air.
But this was not invariably true; and the case of Pilate
and his court might have been an exception.</p>

<p>It has been sought to lay particular stress upon the
doctrine of legal presumption that what should have
been done, was done, unless the record affirmatively
negatives the fact, because it is impossible to appreciate
fully the legal aspects of the trial of Jesus, unless this
doctrine is understood and kept constantly in view.</p>

<p>A casual perusal of the New Testament narratives
leaves the impression upon the mind of the reader that
the proceedings against Jesus before Pilate were exceedingly
irregular and lacking in all the essential elements
of a regular trial. As a matter of fact, this
impression may be grounded in absolute truth. It may
be that the action of Pilate was arbitrary and devoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of all legal forms. This possibility is strengthened by
the consideration that Jesus was not a Roman citizen
and could not, therefore, demand the strict observance
of forms of law in His trial. A Jewish provincial,
when accused of crime, stood before a Roman governor
with no other rights than the plea of justice as a defense
against the summary exercise of absolute power.
In other words, in the case of Jesus, Pilate was not
bound to observe strictly rules of criminal procedure
prescribed by Roman law. He could, if he saw fit, dispense
with forms of law and dispose of the case either
equitably or as his whims suggested. Nor was there
a right of appeal in such a case, from the judgment of
the procurator to the emperor at Rome. The decision
of the governor against a provincial was final. The
case of Paul before Felix and before Festus was entirely
different. Paul was a Roman citizen and, as
such, was entitled to all the rights involved in Roman
citizenship, which included the privilege of an appeal
to Cæsar against the judgment of a provincial officer;
and he actually exercised this right.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It was incumbent,
therefore, upon Roman officials to observe due
forms of law in proceeding against him. And St.
Luke, in Acts xxiv., indicates the almost exact precision
and formality of a Roman trial, in the case of
Paul.</p>

<p>But the fact that Jesus was not a Roman citizen does
not prove that due forms of law were not observed in
His trial. It is hardly probable, as before observed,
that despotism and caprice were tolerated at any time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>in any part of the Roman world. And, besides, Roman
history and jurisprudence are replete with illustrations
of complete legal protection extended by Roman officials
to the non-Roman citizens of subject states. It
is, moreover, a legitimate and almost inevitable inference,
drawn from the very nature of the Roman constitution
and from the peculiar character of Roman
judicial administration, that no human life belonging
to a citizen or subject of Rome would be permitted
to be taken without due process of law, either imperial
or local.</p>

<p>In forming an opinion as to the existence or non-existence
of a regular trial of Jesus before Pilate, the
meager details of the New Testament histories must
not alone be relied upon. Nor must it be forgotten
that the Gospel writers were not lawyers or court officers
reporting a case to be reviewed on appeal. They
were laymen writing a general account of a judicial
transaction. And the omissions in their narratives are
not to be considered as either discrepancies or falsehoods.
They simply did not intend to tell everything
about the trial of Jesus; and the fact that they do not
record the successive steps of a regular trial does not
mean that these steps were not observed.</p>

<p>It is respectfully submitted that if a modern layman
should write a newspaper or book account of one of the
great criminal trials of this century, with no intention
of making it a strictly judicial report, this account
would not reveal the presence of more essential legal
elements than are disclosed by the reports of the Evangelists
of the proceedings against Jesus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>The majority of writers on the subject express the
opinion that the appearance of the Christ before the
Roman governor was nothing more than a short hearing
in which a few questions were asked and answers
made; that the proceedings were exceedingly brief and
informal; and that the emergencies of the case rather
than forms of law guided the judgment and controlled
the conduct of Pilate. As a layman, the author of these
volumes would take the same view. But as a lawyer,
treating the subject in a judicial manner, and bound by
legal rules, regulations, and presumptions, in reviewing
the merits of the case, he feels constrained to dissent
from the prevalent opinion and to declare that
the New Testament records, though meager in details,
exhibit all the essential elements of an ordinary criminal
trial, whether conducted in ancient or modern
times. He further asserts that if the affirmative statements
of the Evangelists that certain things were done
be supplemented by the legal presumption that still
other things were done because they should have been
done, and because the record does not affirmatively declare
that they were not done, an almost perfect judicial
proceeding can be developed from the Gospel
reports of the trial of Jesus before Pilate. These reports
disclose the following essential elements of all
ancient and modern criminal trials:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The Indictment, or <i>Nominis Delatio</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">"What accusation bring ye against this
man?"</p>
<p class="hang">"And they began to accuse him, saying, We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>found this fellow perverting the nation,
and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar,
saying that he himself is Christ a King."</p>
<p>2. The Examination, or <i>Interrogatio</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">"Art thou the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p class="hang">"Art thou a King then?"</p>

<p>3. The Defense, or <i>Excusatio</i>.</p>
<p class="hang">"My kingdom is not of this world: if my
kingdom were of this world then would
my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
to the Jews: but now is my kingdom
not from hence.... To this end
was I born and for this cause came I into
the world, that I should bear witness unto
the truth. Everyone that is of the truth
heareth my voice."</p>

<p>4. The Acquittal, or <i>Absolutio</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">"I find in him no fault at all."
</p></div>

<p>Here we have clearly presented the essential features
of a criminal trial: the Indictment, the Examination
of the charge, the Defense, and the Judgment
of the tribunal, which, in this case, was an
Acquittal.</p>

<p>To demonstrate that Pilate intended to conduct the
proceedings against Jesus seriously and judicially, at
the beginning of the trial, let us briefly review the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
attendant upon the successive steps just
enumerated. And to this end, let us proceed in
order:</p>

<p>1. The Indictment, or <i>Nominis Delatio</i>.</p>

<p>When Pilate had seated himself in the ivory curule
chair of the procurator of Judea, at an early hour on
Friday morning, the day of the crucifixion of Jesus, a
Jerusalem mob, led by the Sanhedrin, confronted him
with the prisoner. His first recorded words are:
"What accusation bring ye against this man?" As
before suggested, this question is very keenly indicative
of the presence of the judge and of the beginning of a
solemn judicial proceeding. Every word rings with
Roman authority and strongly suggests administrative
action.</p>

<p>The accusing priests sought to evade this question
by answering: "If he were not a malefactor, we would
not have delivered him up unto thee."</p>

<p>If Pilate had adopted the Jewish view of the merits
of the matter, that his countersign was the only thing
necessary to justify the final condemnation and punishment
of the prisoner; or, if he had been indifferent to
the legal aspects of the case, he would simply have
granted their request at once, and would have ordered
the prisoner to execution. But this was not the case;
for we are assured that he insisted on knowing the nature
of the accusation before he would assume jurisdiction
of the affair. The mere information that He
was a "malefactor" did not suffice. The conduct of
the Roman judge clearly indicated that accusation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
a more important element of Roman criminal procedure
than was inquisition. To meet the emergency,
the Jews were compelled, then, to make the formal
charge, that:</p>

<p>"We found this fellow perverting the nation, and
forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he
himself is Christ a King."</p>

<p>Here we have presented the indictment, the first step
in a criminal proceeding; and it was presented not voluntarily,
but because a Roman judge, acting judicially,
demanded and forced its presentment.</p>

<p>2. The Examination, or <i>Interrogatio</i>.</p>

<p>Not content with knowing the nature of the charges
against the prisoner, Pilate insisted on finding out
whether they were true or not. He accordingly took
Jesus inside the palace and interrogated Him. With
true judicial tact, he brushed aside the first two accusations
as unimportant, and came with pointed directness
to the material question:</p>

<p>"Art thou the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>This interrogation bears the impress of a judicial inquiry,
touching a matter involving the question of high
treason, the charge against the prisoner. It clearly indicates
a legal proceeding in progress. And when
Jesus made reply that seemed to indicate guilt, the
practiced ear of the Roman judge caught the suggestion
of a criminal confession, and he asked impatiently:</p>

<p>"Art thou a King then?"</p>

<p>This question indicates seriousness and a resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to get at the bottom of the matter with a view to a
serious judicial determination of the affair.</p>

<p>3. The Defense, or <i>Excusatio</i>.</p>

<p>In reply to the question of the judge, the prisoner
answered:</p>

<p>"My kingdom is not of this world."</p>

<p>This language indicates that Jesus was conscious of
the solemnity of the proceedings; and that <span class="err" title="original: he">He</span> recognized
the right of Pilate to interrogate Him judicially.
His answer seemed to say: "I recognize your authority
in matters of this life and this world. If my claims
to kingship were temporal, I fully appreciate that they
would be treasonable; and that, as the representative of
Cæsar, you would be justified in delivering me to
death. But my pretensions to royalty are spiritual, and
this places the matter beyond your reach."</p>

<p>The defense of Jesus was in the nature of what we
call in modern pleading a Confession and Avoidance:
"A plea which admits, in words or in effect, the truth
of the matter contained in the Declaration; and alleges
some new matter to avoid the effect of it, and
shows that the plaintiff is, notwithstanding, not entitled
to his action."</p>

<p>It may be analyzed thus:</p>

<p>Confession: Inside the palace, Pilate asked Jesus
the question: "Art thou the King of the Jews?" According
to St. Matthew, Jesus answered: "Thou
sayest";<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> according to St. Mark: "Thou sayest
it";<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> according to St. Luke: "Thou sayest it";<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>according to St. John: "Thou sayest that I am a
king."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>All these replies are identical in signification, and
mean: Thou sayest it, because I am really a king. In
other words, He simply confessed that He was a
king. Then came His real defense.</p>

<p>Avoidance: "My kingdom is not of this world: if
my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants
fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews:
but now is my kingdom not from hence.... To this
end was I born and for this cause came I into the
world, that I should bear witness of the truth. Everyone
that is of the truth heareth my voice."</p>

<p>After having confessed claims to kingship, and having
thereby made Himself momentarily liable on the
charge of high treason, He at once avoids the effect of
the declaration by alleging new matter which exempted
Him from the operation of the <i>crimen Læsæ
Majestatis</i>. He boldly declares His kingship, but
places His kingdom beyond the skies in the realm of
truth and spirit. He asserts a bold antithesis between
the Empire of Cæsar and the Kingdom of God. He
cheerfully acknowledges the procuratorship of Pilate
in the first, but fearlessly proclaims His own Messiahship
in the second.</p>

<p>4. The Acquittal, or <i>Absolutio</i>.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that Pilate's heathen soul
mocked the heavenly claims of the lowly prisoner in
his presence, but his keenly discerning Roman intellect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>marked at once the distinction between an earthly and
a heavenly kingdom. He saw clearly that their boundaries
nowhere conflicted, and that treasonable contact
was impossible. He judged that Jesus was simply a
gentle enthusiast whose pretensions were harmless.
Accordingly, he went out to the mob and pronounced
a verdict of "not guilty." Solemnly raising his hand,
he proclaimed the sentence of acquittal:</p>

<p>"I find in him no fault at all."</p>

<p>This language is not the classical legal phraseology
of a Roman verdict of acquittal. The Latin word for
a single ballot was <i>absolvo</i>; the words of a collective
judgment of a bench of judges was <i>non fecisse videtur</i>.
The language of St. John, though that of a layman, is
equally as effectual, if not so formal and judicial.</p>

<p>More than any other feature of the case, the verdict
of acquittal, "I find in him no fault at all," indicates
the regularity and solemnity of a judicial proceeding.
Standing alone, it would indicate the close of a regular
trial in which a court having jurisdiction had sat in
judgment upon the life or liberty of an alleged
criminal.</p>

<p>If to these essential elements of a trial which the
Gospel records affirmatively disclose be added other
necessary elements of a regular Roman trial which
legal presumption supplies, because these records do
not deny their existence, we have then in the proceedings
against Jesus all the important features of Roman
criminal procedure involving the question of life or
death. That several essential elements are absent is
evident from a reasonable construction of the statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of the Evangelists. That which most forcibly
negatives the existence of a regular trial was the precipitancy
with which the proceedings were conducted
before Pilate. We have seen that ten days were allowed
at Rome after the <i>nominis receptio</i> to secure testimony
and prepare the case before the beginning of
the trial. This rule was certainly not observed at the
trial of Jesus. But several irregularities which are
apparent from a perusal of the Gospel histories may
be explained from the fact that Jesus was not a
Roman citizen and was not, therefore, entitled to a
strict observance of Roman law in the proceedings
against him.</p>

<p>The foregoing analysis and summary apply only to
the proceedings of the first appearance of Jesus before
Pilate. It was at this time that the real Roman trial
took place. All subsequent proceedings were irregular,
tumultuous and absolutely illegal. The examination
of Jesus by Herod cannot, strictly speaking, be
called a trial. The usual explanation of the sending
of the prisoner to Herod is that Pilate learned that He
was a native and citizen of Galilee; and that, desiring
to rid himself of an embarrassing subject, he determined
to transfer the accused from the <i>forum apprehensionis</i>
to the <i>forum originis vel domicilii</i>. It has
frequently been asserted that it was usual in Roman
procedure to transfer a prisoner from the place of
arrest to the place of his origin or residence. There
seems to be no authority for this contention. It may
or may not have been true as a general proposition.
But it was certainly not true in the case of the transfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
of Jesus to Herod. In the first place, when Pilate declared,
"I find no fault in him at all," a verdict of
acquittal was pronounced, and the case was ended.
The proceedings had taken form of <i>res adjudicata</i>, and
former jeopardy could have been pleaded in bar of
further prosecution. It might be differently contended
if Pilate had discovered that Jesus was from Galilee
before the proceedings before him were closed. But it
is clear from St. Luke, who alone records the occurrence
of the sending of the prisoner to Herod, that the
case was closed and the verdict of acquittal had been
rendered before Pilate discovered the identity of the
accused.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> It was then too late to subject a prisoner to
a second trial for the same offense.</p>

<p>Rosadi denies emphatically that Herod had jurisdiction
of the offense charged against Jesus. In this
connection, he says: "His prosecutors insisted tenaciously
upon His answering to a charge of <i>continuous</i>
sedition, as lawyers call it. This offence had been
begun in Galilee and ended in Jerusalem&mdash;that is to
say, in Judæa. Now it was a rule of Roman law,
which the procurator of Rome could neither fail to
recognize nor afford to neglect, that the competence
of a court territorially constituted was determined
either by the place in which the arrest was made, or
by the place in which the offence was committed.
Jesus had been arrested at the gates of Jerusalem; His
alleged offence had been committed for the most part,
and as far as all the final acts were concerned, in the
city itself and in other localities of Judæa. In continuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>offences competence was determined by the place
in which the last acts going to constitute the offence
had been committed. Thus no justification whatever
existed for determining the court with regard to the
prisoner's origin. But this investigation upon a point
of Roman law is to all intents superfluous, because
either Pilate, when he thought of Herod, intended to
strip himself of his inalienable judicial power, and in
this case he ought to have respected the jurisdiction
and competence of the Grand Sanhedrin and not to
have busied himself with a conflict as to cognizance
which should only have been discussed and resolved
by the Jewish judicial authorities; or else he had no
intention of abdicating his power, and in this case he
ought never to have raised the question of competence
between himself, Governor of Judæa, and Herod,
Regent of Galilee, but between himself and the Roman
Vice-Governor of Galilee, his colleague, if there had
been such an one. It is only between judges of the
same judicial hierarchy that a dispute as to territorial
competence can arise. Between magistrates of different
States there can only exist a contrast of power and
jurisdiction. The act of Pilate cannot then be interpreted
as a scruple of a constitutional character. It is
but a miserable escape for his irresolution, a mere endeavour
to temporize."</p>

<p>The second and final appearance of Jesus before
Pilate bears little resemblance to a regular trial. The
characteristic elements of an ordinary Roman criminal
proceeding are almost wholly wanting. The pusillanimous
cowardice of the procurator and the blind fury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of the mob are the chief component parts. A sort of
wild phantasmagoria sweeps through the multitude
and circles round the tribunal of the governor. Pilate
struggles with his conscience, and seeks safety in subterfuge.
He begins by declaring to the assembled
priests and elders that neither he nor Herod has found
any fault in the man; and then, as a means of compromise
and conciliation, makes the monstrous proposal
that he will first scourge and then release the prisoner.
This infamous proposal is rejected by the mob. The
cowardly procurator then adopts another mean expedient
as a way of escape. He offers to deliver Jesus to
them as a Passover gift. Him they refuse and Barabbas,
the robber, is demanded. Pilate's terror is intensified
by superstitious dread, when the mob begins to
cry: "He made himself the Son of God!" From out
the anguish of his soul, the voice of Justice sends to
his quivering lips the thrice-repeated question: "Why,
what evil hath he done?" The mob continues to cry:
"Crucify him! Crucify him!"</p>

<p>And as a final assault upon his conscience and his
courage, the hypocritical priests warn him that he
must not release a pretender to kingship, for such a
man is an enemy to Cæsar. The doom of the Nazarene
is sealed by this last maneuver of the rabble. Then, as
a propitiation to the great God of truth and justice,
and as balm to his hurt and wounded conscience, he
washes his hands in front of them and exclaims: "I
am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye
to it."</p>

<p>The crucifixion followed Pilate's final determination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
and thus ended the most famous trial in the history
of the world. It began with the arrest of Jesus
in Gethsemane at midnight, and ended with His crucifixion
on Golgotha on the afternoon of the same day.
As we have seen, it was a double trial, conducted
within the jurisdictions of the two most famous systems
of jurisprudence known to mankind. In both trials,
substantially the right issue was raised. Before the
Sanhedrin, the prisoner was charged with blasphemy
and convicted. Regarding Jesus as a mere man, a
plain Jewish citizen, this judgment was "substantially
right in point of law", but was unjust and outrageous
because forms of criminal procedure which
every Jewish prisoner was entitled to have observed,
were completely ignored.</p>

<p>The proceedings before Pilate, we have reason to
believe, were conducted, in a general way, with due
regard to forms of law. But the result was judicial
murder, because the judge, after having acquitted
Jesus, delivered Him to be crucified. "I find in him
no fault at all" was the verdict of Pilate. But this
just and righteous sentence was destroyed and obliterated
by the following: "And they were instant with
loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And
the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they
required."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>A horrible travesty on justice, this! "<i>Absolvo</i>"
and "<i>Ibis ad crucem</i>," in the same breath, were the
final utterances of a Roman judge administering Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>law in the most memorable judicial transaction
known to men.</p>

<p>The treatment of this great theme would be incomplete
and unsatisfactory unless reference were made to
the peculiar views of some who believe that political
rather than legal considerations should govern in determining
the justice or the injustice of the proceedings
against Jesus before Pilate. A certain class of critics
insist on regarding the Roman governor in the light
of an administrator rather than a judge, and contend
that the justice of his conduct and the righteousness of
his motives should be tested by principles of public
policy rather than by strict legal rules. It is insisted
by such persons that various considerations support
this contention. It is pointed out that Pilate exercised
the unlimited jurisdiction of the military <i>imperium</i>,
and was not, therefore, strictly bound by legal rules;
that Jesus was not a Roman citizen, and, for this reason,
was not entitled to the strict observance of forms
of law; and that the stubborn, rebellious and turbulent
temper of the Jewish people required the strong hand
of a military governor, enforcing political obedience
by drastic measures, rather than the action of a judge
punctiliously applying rules of law. These peculiar
views subject the conduct of Pilate to the pressure
of public necessity rather than to the test of private
right, and insist that sympathy rather than censure
should hold the scales in which his deeds are
weighed.</p>

<p>This view of the case was presented in the last generation
by Sir James Fitz-James Stephen in a book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
extraordinary strength and brilliancy entitled "Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity." It was written in answer
to John Stuart Mill, and is, without doubt, the most
powerful assault in the English language on what men
have been pleased to call in modern times "liberty of
conscience." In his letters and essays, Mr. Mill, according
to the interpretation of Mr. Stephen, "condemns
absolutely all interference with the expression
of opinion." When tried by this standard, the Athenian
dicasts, who condemned Socrates; Marcus Aurelius,
who persecuted the Christians; Pontius Pilate,
who crucified Jesus; and Philip II, who sanctioned the
tortures of the Spanish Inquisition, were simply violators
of rights of personal opinion and of freedom of
conscience. If you deny the right of liberty of conscience,
Mr. Mill contends, you must not censure
Marcus Aurelius and other persecutors of Christianity.
On the contrary, you must approve such persecution;
and you must go further, and find "a principle which
would justify Pontius Pilate." This challenge was
boldly accepted by Mr. Stephen, who says:</p>

<p>"Was Pilate right in crucifying Christ? I reply,
Pilate's paramount duty was to preserve the peace in
Palestine, to form the best judgment he could as to the
means required for that purpose, and to act upon it
when it was formed. Therefore, if and in so far as he
believed in good faith and on reasonable grounds that
what he did was necessary for the preservation of the
peace of Palestine, he was right. It was his duty to
run the risk of being mistaken, notwithstanding Mr.
Mill's principle as to liberty. He was in the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
of a judge whose duty it is to try persons duly brought
before him for trial at the risk of error."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>This contention is founded upon the inexorable doctrine
that what is, is right; that revolution, though
righteous, must be nipped in the bud and destroyed;
and that rights of private conscience must not be tolerated
if they tend to disturb the peace of the community
at large. The inevitable logic of the theory of
Mr. Stephen is that the established order of things in
Palestine under Roman rule was right, and that it was
the duty of the Roman governor to regard all attempts
at innovation or revolution in religion or government
as a breach of the peace which was to be promptly suppressed
by vigorous measures. There is undoubtedly
a certain amount of truth in this contention, in so far
as it implies that under a just and orderly plan of government,
the rights of the commonwealth to peace and
security are greater than the claims of the individual
to liberty of conscience which conflict with and tend
to destroy those rights. It is a truth, at once sovereign
and fundamental, in both law and government, that
the rights of the collective body are greater than those
of any individual member; and that when the rights
of the whole and those of a part of the body politic
conflict, the rights of the part must yield and, if necessity
requires it, be destroyed. Upon no other basis can
the doctrine of majorities in politics and the right of
Eminent Domain in law, rest. But the application of
the principles involved in this theory must always be
made with proper limitations, and with a due regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>to the rights of minorities and individuals; else government
becomes an engine of despotism instead of an
expression of political freedom. A claim of privilege
which every member of the community has a right to
make, must be respected by the collective body; otherwise,
a common right has been violated and destroyed.
The complete recognition of this principle is imperative
and fundamental, and is the corner stone of political
freedom in free institutions among men.</p>

<p>But the trouble with the contention of Mr. Stephen
is that it proceeds upon a wrong hypothesis. He intimates
that Pilate might have "believed in good
faith that what he did was necessary for the preservation
of the peace of Palestine." This is a purely gratuitous
and unhistorical suggestion. The Gospel records
nowhere justify such an assumption. The very
opposite is taught by these sacred writings. It is true
that Caiaphas contended that it was expedient that one
man should die rather than that the whole nation should
perish. But this was a Jewish, not a Roman opinion.
The Evangelical narratives are unanimous in declaring
that Pilate believed Jesus to be innocent and that
"for envy" He had been accused by His countrymen.</p>

<p>It is cheerfully conceded that occasions may present
themselves, in the tumult and frenzy of revolution,
when the responsible authorities of government may
put to death a person whose intentions are innocent,
but whose acts are incentives to riot and bloodshed.
This may be done upon the principle of self-preservation,
which is the first law of government as well as of
nature. But no such necessity arose in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Jesus; and no such motives are ascribed by the Evangelists
to Pilate. They very clearly inform us that the
action of the Roman governor in delivering the prisoner
to be crucified was prompted by private and not
public considerations. He had no fears that Jesus
would precipitate a revolution dangerous to the Roman
state. He simply wished to quiet the mob and
retain his position as procurator of Judea. The facts
of history, then, do not support the contention of Mr.
Stephen.</p>

<p>Continuing, in another place, the same eminent
writer says: "The point to which I wish to direct attention
is that Pilate's duty was to maintain peace and
order in Judea and to maintain the Roman power. It
is surely impossible to contend seriously that it was his
duty, or that it could be the duty of any one in his position,
to recognize in the person brought to his judgment
seat, I do not say God Incarnate, but the teacher
and preacher of a higher form of morals and a more
enduring form of social order than that of which he
himself was the representative. To a man in Pilate's
position the morals and the social order which he represents
are for all practical purposes final and absolute
standards. If, in order to evade the obvious inference
from this, it is said that Pilate ought to have respected
the principle of religious liberty as propounded by
Mr. Mill, the answer is that if he had done so he would
have run the risk of setting the whole province in a
blaze. It is only in very modern times, and under the
influence of modern sophisms, that belief and action
have come to be so much separated in these parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the world that the distinction between the temporal
and spiritual department of affairs even appears to be
tenable; but this is a point for future discussion.</p>

<p>"If this should appear harsh, I would appeal again
to Indian experience. Suppose that some great religious
reformer&mdash;say, for instance, some one claiming to be the
Guru of the Sikhs, or the Imam in whose advent many
Mahommedans devoutly believe&mdash;were to make his
appearance in the Punjab or the North-West Provinces.
Suppose that there was good reason to believe&mdash;and
nothing is more probable&mdash;that whatever might
be the preacher's own personal intentions, his preaching
was calculated to disturb the public peace and produce
mutiny and rebellion: and suppose further
(though the supposition is one which it is hardly possible
to make even in imagination), that a British
officer, instead of doing whatever might be necessary,
or executing whatever orders he might receive, for the
maintenance of British authority, were to consider
whether he ought not to become a disciple of the Guru
or Imam. What course would be taken towards him?
He would be instantly dismissed with ignominy from
the service which he would disgrace, and if he acted
up to his convictions, and preferred his religion to his
Queen and country, he would be hanged as a rebel and
a traitor."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>These theories and illustrations are not only plausible
but entirely reasonable when viewed in the light
of the facts which they assume to be true. But here
again, we must insist that they do not harmonize with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>the actual facts of the case to which they are intended
to apply. In the extract above quoted, three suppositions
are suggested. The first one is immaterial. Let
us analyze the other two in the light of the Gospel histories.
The second supposition is this: "Suppose that
there was good reason to believe&mdash;and nothing is more
probable&mdash;that whatever might be the preacher's own
personal intentions, his preaching was calculated to
disturb the public peace and produce mutiny and rebellion."
What passage of Scripture, it may be asked,
justifies this parallel with the case of Jesus before Pilate?
There is, in fact, absolutely none. The nearest
approach to one is Matthew xxvii. 24: "When
Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that
rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed
his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent
of the blood of this just person: see ye to it." The
"tumult" here referred to means nothing more than
the manifestation of agitated feelings on the part of
the mob, who were enraged at the prospect of an acquittal
by the governor. It does not remotely refer to
the danger of a popular rebellion which might endanger
the security and safety of Rome. To admit
this supposition would be to elevate the motives of
Pilate in consenting to the crucifixion of Jesus to the
level of solicitude for the welfare of his country.
This would not be justified by the record, which
clearly reveals that Pilate was moved by personal selfishness
rather than by a sense of official duty.</p>

<p>The third and last supposition above mentioned is
this: "And suppose, further (though the supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
is one which it is hardly possible to make even in imagination),
that a British officer, instead of doing
whatever might be necessary, or executing whatever
orders he might receive, for the maintenance of British
authority, were to consider whether he ought not to
become a disciple of the Guru or Imam." Here again,
we may ask, what passage of Scripture supports this
parallel of a Mohammedan Guru before a British officer
with Jesus Christ before Pontius Pilate? Where
is it anywhere stated, or by reasonable inference implied,
that Pilate considered whether he ought not to
become a disciple of Jesus? The celebrated English
author has simply argued his case from a radically
defective record of fact.</p>

<p>On the other hand, let us draw what we conceive to
be a true parallel. Let us take an illustration nearer
home. Suppose that the Governor General of the
Philippine Islands was clothed with authority of life
and death as a judge in criminal matters pertaining to
the affairs of those islands. Suppose that a Mohammedan
preacher should appear somewhere in the
archipelago where Mohammedans are numerous, and
begin to proclaim a new religious faith which was opposed
not only to the ordinary tenets of Islamism, but
also to the Christian religion which is the dominant
faith of the rulers of the Philippines. Suppose that
the coreligionists of this Mohammedan prophet should
seize him, bring him before the Governor General,
and lodge against him a threefold charge: That he was
stirring up sedition in the islands; that he had advised
the Filipinos not to pay taxes due to the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
government; and that he had said and done things that
were treasonable against the United States. Suppose
that the Governor General, after personal examination,
became satisfied that the Mohamammedan preacher
was an innocent enthusiast, that the charges against
him were false, and were due to the envy and hatred
of his fellow-Mohammedans; that to quiet the passions,
and satisfy the demands of the mob, he proposed
to scourge him first and then release him; that, in the
face of the vehement accusations of the rabble, he
hesitated and vacillated for several hours; and that
finally, when the Mohammedans threatened to send a
complaint to President Roosevelt which might endanger
his position, he ordered his innocent prisoner to
death. Suppose this should happen beneath the
American flag, what would be the judgment of the
American people as to the merits of the proceedings?
Would the Governor General retain his office by such
a course of conduct?</p>

<p>But let us view it in another light. Let us assume
that the Governor General believed that the Mohammedan
preacher was innocent and that his "personal
intentions" were not remotely hostile or treasonable,
but felt that his preaching might stir up rebellion dangerous
to the power of the American government in
the Philippines; and that it was his duty as the guardian
of American honor and security, to put the native
preacher to death; and this not to punish past criminal
conduct, but to prevent future trouble by a timely execution.
Suppose that the Governor General should
do this while sitting as a judge, would it not be judicial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
murder? Suppose that he should do it while acting as
an administrator, would it be less an assassination?
Would it not stamp with indelible shame the administration
that should sanction or tolerate it? Would
the press of America not denounce the act as murder,
declare that despotism reigned in our Eastern
possessions, and demand the removal and punishment
of the man who had disgraced his office and
brought odium upon the administrative justice of his
country?</p>

<p>In closing the Roman trial of Jesus, let us repeat
what we have already said: that the conduct of Pilate,
when the prisoner was first brought before him, seems
to have been marked by judicial regularity and solemnity;
that the Roman procurator seems to have deported
himself in a manner worthy of his office; that, in the
beginning, he appears to have resolved to observe due
forms of law in the proceedings, to the end that justice
might be attained; and that, after a comparatively
regular trial, he pronounced an absolute verdict of acquittal.
Thus far the course of Pilate is manly and
courageous. But with the return of the prisoner from
Herod, unmanliness and cowardice begin.</p>

<p>This last act of the great drama presents a pitiable
spectacle of Roman degeneracy. A Roman governor of
courtly origin, clothed with <i>imperium</i>, with a Prætorian
Cohort at his command, and the military authority
and resources of an empire at his back, cringes and
crouches before a Jerusalem mob. The early Christian
writers characterized Pilate with a single term
(<span lang="el" title="Greek: anandria">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8055;&#945;</span>), "unmanliness." They were right. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
word is a summary, accurate and complete, of the character
of the man.</p>

<p>There is inherent in the highest and noblest of the
human species a quality of courage which knows no
fear; that prefers death and annihilation to dishonor
and disgrace; that believes, with Cæsar, that it is better
to die at once than to live always in fear of death;
and, with Mahomet, that Paradise will be found in
the shadow of the crossing of swords. This quality of
courage is peculiar to no race of men and to no form
of civilization. It has existed everywhere and at all
times. It causes the spirit of man to tread the earth
like a lion and to mount the air like an eagle. The
ancient barbarians of Gaul believed that lightning was
a menace from the skies; and amidst the very fury of
the storm, from their great bows they sent arrows
heavenward as a defiance to the gods. This quality of
courage, which is natural to man, Pilate lacked. And
when we think of his cowardly, cringing, crouching,
vacillating conduct before a few fanatical priests in
Jerusalem, another scene at another time comes up
before us. The Tenth Legion rises in mutiny and defies
Julius Cæsar. The mighty Roman summons his rebellious
soldiers to the Field of Mars, reads to them the
Roman riot act, and threatens to dismiss them not only
from his favor but from Roman military service. The
veterans of a hundred Gallic battlefields are subdued
and conquered by the tone and glance of a single man;
and with tearful eyes, beg forgiveness, and ask to be
permitted to follow once again him and his eagles to
the feast of victory and of death. Imagine, if you can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Cæsar in the place of Pilate. it is not difficult to conceive
the fare of a vulgar rabble who persisted in annoying
such a Roman by demanding the blood of an
innocent man.</p>

<p>But the cowardice and pusillanimity of the Roman
governor are not properly illustrated by comparison
with the courage and magnanimity of a Roman general.
At the trial of Jesus, Pilate was acting in a judicial
capacity, and was essentially a judge. His character,
then, may be best understood by contrasting it
with another judge in another age and country. His
craven qualities will then be manifest.</p>

<p>The greatest of the English jurists and judges was
Sir Edward Coke. His legal genius was superb and
his judicial labors prodigious. During the greater
part of his professional career he slept only six hours,
"and from three in the morning till nine at night he
read or took notes of the cases tried in Westminster
Hall with as little interruption as possible." He was
great not only as a judge, but as an advocate as well.
The consummate skill with which he argued the intricate
cases of Lord Cromwell and Edward Shelley,
brought him a practice never before equaled in England,
and made him renowned as the greatest lawyer
of the times. His erudition was profound, his powers
of advocacy brilliant, his personal and judicial
courage was magnificent. He not only repeatedly defied
and ridiculed his colleagues on the bench, but
more than once excited the wrath and braved the anger
of the king. He fearlessly planted himself upon the
ancient and inalienable rights of Englishmen; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
time and time again, interposed his robe at office
between the privileges of the Commons and the aggressions
of the Crown. He boldly declared that a
royal proclamation could not make that an offense
which was not an offense before. His unswerving independence
was well illustrated in a case brought
before him in 1616. The question at issue was the
validity of a grant made by the king to the Bishop of
Lichfield of a benefice to be held <i>in commendam</i>.
King James, through his attorney-general, Bacon,
commanded the chief justice to delay judgment till he
himself had discussed the question with the judges.
Bacon, at Coke's request, sent a letter containing the
same command to each of the judges. Coke then
obtained their signatures to a paper declaring that
the instructions of the attorney-general were illegal,
and that they were bound to proceed with the
case. The king became very angry, summoned the
judges before him in the council chamber, declared to
them his kingly prerogative, and forbade them to discuss
his royal privileges in ordinary arguments before
their tribunal. Coke's colleagues fell upon their knees,
cowed and terrified, before the royal bigot and despot,
and begged his pardon for having expressed an opinion
that had excited his displeasure. But Coke refused
to yield, and, when asked if, in the future, he would
delay a case at the king's order, he bravely replied that
on all occasions and under any emergency, he would
do nothing unworthy of himself or his office as an English
citizen and judge. And rather than prostitute the
high prerogatives of his court, he indignantly and contemptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
hurled his judicial mantle into the face of
the Stuart king. How much grander and nobler was
the conduct of Coke, the Englishman, than that of Pilate,
the cowardly, pusillanimous Roman! Both were
judges, both stood in the shadow of the majesty and
menace of a throne, both were threatened with royal
wrath, both held high judicial places under the governments
of the most vast and glorious empires that
this world has known. Coke preferred the dictates of
his conscience to the decrees of his king; and his name
remains forever enshrined in the minds and memories
of men as the noblest type of a brave and righteous
judge. For a miserable mess of Roman political pottage,
Pilate forfeited his birthright to the most splendid
and illustrious example of judicial integrity and
courage in the history of the earth; and his name remains
forever a hissing and reproach, as the worst
specimen of the corrupt and cowardly judge that mankind
has known.</p>

<p>If it be objected that the position of Pilate was more
painful and precarious than that of Coke, because the
Roman was confronted by a wild and furious mob,
reply must then be made that both the spirit and letter
of Roman laws forbade surrender by Roman governors
and administrators of the principles of justice to
the blind passions of the multitude. This spirit was,
in a later age, set forth in the laws of Justinian, when
reproduction was made of the proclamations of the
emperors Diocletian and Maximian, on the occasion
of a public riot, that "the vain clamors of the people
are not to be heeded, seeing that it is in no wise necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
to pay any attention to the cries of those desiring
the acquittal of the guilty, or the condemnation of the
innocent."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Pilate yielded to the demands of the mob when his
country's laws forbade it. His intellect willed the execution
of an innocent man when his conscience condemned
it. "Such was the man whose cowardice,
made manifest in the most supreme and memorable act
of injustice the world has ever known, was destined
to earn him eternal infamy. To him and to no others
pointed the poet as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">'colui<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Che fece per viltate il gran rifiuto;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to him, the prototype of that long train of those who
were never quite alive, who vainly sought glory in
this world, vainly dreaded infamy; who, ever wavering
betwixt good and evil, washed their hands; who,
like the neutral angels of the threshold, were neither
faithful nor rebellious; who are equally despised by
pity and justice; who render themselves</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A Dio spiacenti ed ai nemici sui.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And what man other than Pilate was ever placed so
typically, in such accordance with the eyes of the poet,
between the Son of God and His enemies, between justice
and mercy, between right and wrong, between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>Emperor and the Jews, and has refused either issue of
the dilemma?</p>

<p>"Was it Celestine, Diocletian, or Esau? But they of
two things chose the one; and who knows but that they
chose the better? A hermitage and a mess of pottage
may under many aspects be better worth than the
papacy renounced by Celestine, than the empire abdicated
by Diocletian, or than the birthright bartered by
Esau. But Pilate refused to choose, and his refusal
was great&mdash;great enough to justify the antonomasia of
Dante&mdash;and it was cowardly. He refused not only the
great gift of free will in a case when a free choice
was his absolute duty. When admitted, like the fallen
angels, to the great choice between good and evil, he
did not cleave for ever to the good, as did <span class="err" title="original: S.">St.</span> Michael,
or to the evil, as did Lucifer, but he refused a power
which for him was the fount of duty and which cost
the life of a man and the right of an innocent."</p>

<p>But was Pilate alone guilty of the crime of the crucifixion?
Were the Jews wholly blameless? This
raises the question: Who were the real crucifiers of the
Christ, the Jews or the Romans? That the Jews were
the instigators and the Romans the consummators of
the crucifixion is evident from the Gospel narratives.
The Jews made the complaint, and the Romans ordered
and effected the arrest of the prisoner in Gethsemane.
Having tried Him before their own tribunal,
the Jews then led Jesus away to the Roman
governor, and in the Prætorium accused Him and furnished
evidence against Him. But the final act of
crucifying was a Roman act. It is true that Jewish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>elements were present in the crucifixion of Jesus. The
death draught offered Him on the cross suggests a
humane provision of Hebrew law. This drink was
usury administered among the Hebrews "so that the
delinquent might lose clear consciousness through the
ensuing intoxication." Again, the body of Jesus was
removed from the cross and buried before it was night.
This was in deference to an ancient custom of the Jews
to bury criminals before sunset who had first been executed
by stoning for the crime of blasphemy and had
then been subjected to the indignity of being hung
upon a tree, in conformity with a Mosaic ordinance
contained in Deut. xxi. 22. But these two incidents
exhaust the Jewish features of the crucifixion; and,
besides, these elements were merely physical. The
spiritual or moral features, involving turpitude and
crime, are entirely different considerations from those
that are simply historical. The question still arises:
Who were the morally guilty parties? Who were the
directly responsible agents of the crucifixion, the Jews
or the Romans? Upon whom should the greater
blame rest, if both were guilty? A passage from St.
John seems to indicate that the Jews were the bearers
of the greater sin. Replying to a question of Pilate
concerning the procurator's power to crucify Him,
"Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all
against me, except it were given thee from above;
therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the
greater sin."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> According to many commentators,
Jesus referred to Caiaphas; according to others, He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>spoke of Judas as the person who had the greater sin.
But in any case it is certain that He did not intend to
involve the whole Jewish nation in the crime of His
arrest and execution. The language of the scriptural
context indicates a single person. Pilate, on the one
hand, is made the silent instrument in the hands of God
for the accomplishment of the designs of Heaven.
Caiaphas, on the other hand, is probably referred to
as the one having the greater sin, because, being the
high priest of the Sanhedrin, he better understood the
questions involved in the religious charge of blasphemy,
and was, therefore, the greater sinner against
the laws of God, in the matter of the injustice then
being perpetrated.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fp175.jpg" width="600" height="391" alt="THE CRUCIFIXION (MUNKACSY)" title="THE CRUCIFIXION (MUNKACSY)" />
<p class="caption"><a name="THE_CRUCIFIXION" id="THE_CRUCIFIXION"></a>THE CRUCIFIXION (MUNKACSY)</p>
</div>
<hr class="l1" />
<p>Aside from the religious questions involved, and
speaking in the light of history and law, our own judgment
is that the real crucifiers of the Christ were the
Romans, and that Pilate and his countrymen should
bear the greater blame. It is true that the Jews were
the instigators, the accusers. But Pilate was the judge
whose authority was absolute. The Jews were powerless
to inflict the death penalty. Pilate had the final disposition
of all matters of life and death. In short, he
could have prevented the crucifixion of Jesus. He did
not do so; and upon him and his countrymen should
rest the censure of Heaven and the execration of mankind.</p>

<p>But, admitting that the priests of the Sanhedrin
were equally guilty with Pilate and the Romans, does
it follow that all Jews of the days of Jesus who were
not participants in the crime against him, should suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
for the folly and criminal conduct of a mere fragment
of a Sadducean sect? Is it not true that the Jewish
people, as a race, were not parties to the condemnation
and execution of the Christ? Is it not reasonable to
suppose that the masses in Palestine were friendly to
the democratic Reformer who was the friend of the
poor, the lame, and the blind? Did not the reception
of his miracles and his triumphal entry into Jerusalem
indicate His popularity with the plain people? Is it
not historically true that the great body of the Jewish
population in Judea, in Galilee, in Samaria, and in
Perea, was unfriendly to the members of the Sanhedrin,
and regarded them as political renegades and
religious delinquents? Is it not reasonably certain
that a large majority of the countrymen of Jesus were
his ardent well-wishers and sincerely regretted his untimely
end? Is it possible to conceive that these
friends and well-wishers were the inheritors of the
curse of Heaven because of the crime of Golgotha?
If not, is it rational to suppose that their innocent descendants
have been the victims of this curse?</p>

<p>The cruel and senseless notion of the implacable
wrath of Deity has prevailed in all the ages as an explanation
of the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion
and persecution of the Jews. It is worse than
nonsense to see in this event anything but the operation
of vulgar physical forces of the most ordinary kind.
The fall of Jerusalem was a most natural and consequential
thing. It was not even an extraordinary historical
occurrence, even in Jewish history. Titus did
not so completely destroy Jerusalem as did Nebuchadnezzar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
before him. Razing cities to the ground was
a customary Roman act, a form of pastime, a characteristic
Roman proceeding in the case of stubborn and
rebellious towns. Scipio razed Carthage and drove
Carthaginians into the most remote corners of the
earth. Was any Roman or Punic god interested in this
event? Cæsar destroyed many Gallic cities and scattered
Gauls throughout the world. Was any deity
concerned about these things?</p>

<p>Roman admiration was at times enkindled, but
Roman clemency was never gained by deeds of valor
directed against the arms of Rome. Neither Hannibal
nor Mithradates, Vercingetorix nor Jugurtha, the
grandest of her enemies, received any mercy at her
hands. To oppose her will, was to invite destruction;
and the sequel was a mere question of "the survival of
the fittest." The most turbulent, rebellious and determined
of all the imperial dependencies was the province
of Judea. The Jews regarded the Romans as
idolaters; and, instead of obeying them as masters, despised
and defied them as barbarians. When this spirit
became manifest and promised to be perpetual, the
dignity of the Roman name as well as the safety of the
Roman State, demanded the destruction of Jerusalem
and the dispersion of the Jews. And destruction and
dispersion followed as naturally as any profane effect
follows any vulgar cause.</p>

<p>The Irish, another splendid race, are being dispersed
throughout the earth by the English domination
of Ireland. Is anybody so keenly discerning as to
see in Irish dispersion a divine or superhuman agency?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Is it not, after all, the simple operation of the same
brutal, physical forces that destroyed Carthage and
Jerusalem, and, in a latter century, dismembered
Poland?</p>

<p>But the advocates of the divine wrath theory quote
Scriptures and point to prophecy in support of their
contention. Then Scriptures must be pitted against
Scriptures. The last prayer of the Master on the cross
must be made to repeal every earlier Scriptural prophecy
or decree. "Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do," is the sublimest utterance in the
literature of the world. It is the epitome of every
Christian virtue and of all religious truth. This proclamation
from the cross repealed the Mosaic law of
hereditary sin; placed upon a personal basis responsibility
for offenses against God and man; and served
notice upon future generations that those who "know
not what they do" are entitled to be spared and forgiven.
To believe that God ignored the prayer of
Christ on the cross; and that the centuries of persecution
of the Jews which followed, were but the fulfillment
of prophecy and fate, is to assail the Messiahship
of Jesus and to question the goodness and mercy of
Jehovah. Jesus knew the full meaning of His prayer
and was serious unto death. To believe that the Father
rejected the petition of the Son is to destroy the equality
of the persons of the Trinity by investing one with
the authority and power to review, revise, and reject
the judgments and petitions of the others. If the
Christian doctrine be true that Christ was God "manifest
in the flesh"; if the doctrine of the Trinity be true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost, are one and the same, eternal and inseparable,
then the prayer of Jesus on the cross was not a petition,
but a declaration that the malefactors of the crucifixion,
who, in the blindness of ignorance, had helped to
kill the Son of Man, would receive at the Last Day
the benefits of the amnesty of the Father of mercy and
forgiveness.</p>

<p>If the perpetrators of the great injustice of the Sanhedrin
and of the Prætorium are to be forgiven because
they knew not what they did, is there any justice,
human or divine, in persecuting their innocent descendants
of all lands and ages? "When Sir Moses
Montefiore was taunted by a political opponent with
the memory of Calvary and described by him as one
who sprang from the murderers who crucified the
world's Redeemer, the next morning the Jewish philanthropist,
whom Christendom has learned to honor,
called upon his assailant and showed him the record of
his ancestors which had been kept for two thousand
years, and which showed that their home had been in
Spain for two hundred years before Jesus of Nazareth
was born." This half-humorous anecdote illustrates
the utter absurdity and supreme injustice of connecting
the modern Jew with ancient tragic history. The
elemental forces of reason, logic, courage and sympathy,
wrapped up and interwoven in every impulse and
fiber of the human mind and heart, will be forever in
rebellion against the monstrous doctrine of centuries
of shame, exile and persecution visited upon an entire
race, because of the sins and crimes of a handful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
their progenitors who lived more than a thousand
years before.</p>

<p>But, if the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon
the sons is to be maintained, and perpetuated as a form
of divine, if not of human justice, then, why not, at
least, be consistent in the application of the principle?
Many philosophers and critics have detected a striking
kinship between the teachings of Socrates and those of
Jesus. A celebrated historian closes a chapter of the
history of Greece with this sentence: "Thus perished
the greatest and most original of the Grecian philosophers
(Socrates), whose uninspired wisdom made the
nearest approach to the divine morality of the Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The indictments against the philosopher of
Athens and the Prophet of Nazareth were strikingly
similar. Socrates was charged with corrupting Athenian
youth; Jesus, with perverting the nation. Socrates
was charged with treason against Athens; Jesus,
with treason against Rome. Both were charged with
blasphemy; the Athenian, with blasphemy of the
Olympic gods; the Nazarene, with blaspheming Jehovah.
Both sealed with their blood the faith that was
in them. If the descendants of the crucifiers of the
Christ are to be persecuted, brutalized, and exiled for
the sins of the fathers, why not apply the same pitiless
law of hereditary punishment to the descendants of
the Athenian dicasts who administered hemlock to the
greatest sage of antiquity? Why not persecute all the
Greeks of the earth, wherever found, because of the
injustice of the Areopagus?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>
<p>Coming back from antiquity and the Greeks to modern
times in America, let us express the hope that all
forms of race prejudice and persecution will soon cease
forever. It is a truth well known of all intelligent men
that racial prejudice against the Jew has not completely
vanished from the minds and hearts of Gentiles;
that political freedom in an enlightened age has
not brought with it full religious tolerance and social
recognition; that the Jew enjoys the freedom of the
letter, but is still under the ban of the spirit. It is not
necessary to go to Russia to prove this contention. In
1896, Adolf von Sonnenthal, the greatest of modern
actors, who has covered the Austrian stage with glory,
celebrated the fortieth anniversary of his entrance into
theatrical life. The City Council of Vienna refused
to extend him the freedom of the city, because he was
a Jew. In 1906, Madame Bernhardt, the most marvelous
living woman, while acting in Canada, was insulted
by having spoiled eggs thrown upon the stage
amidst shouts of "Down with the Jewess!" This outrage
called forth a letter of apology, which appeared
in public print, from Sir Wilfred Laurier, Prime
Minister of the Dominion. In the summer of 1907,
the sister of Senator Isidor Rayner, of Maryland, was
refused admission to an Atlantic City hotel because
she was a Jewess. Be it remembered that these several
acts of prejudice and persecution did not happen in
the Middle Ages, or under the government of the Romanoffs.
Two of them occurred at the beginning of
the twentieth century, beneath the flags of two of the
freest and most civilized nations of the globe. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
have Americans to say of the exclusion of a virtuous,
refined, intelligent sister of a great American senator
from an American hotel for no other reason than that
she was a Jewess; that is, that she was of the same race
with the Savior of mankind?</p>

<p>There is certainly no place for religious intolerance
and race prejudice beneath our flag. Fake and hypocritical
our religion, if while professing faith in Jesus
we continue to persecute those for whom He prayed!
In vain did Washington, marching in Liberty's vanguard,
"lead Freedom's eaglets to their feast"; in vain
the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence
and the adoption of the Constitution at Philadelphia,
a hundred years ago; in vain the bonfires and orations
of the nation's natal day, if our boasted liberties are to
exist in theory, but not in practice, in fancy, but not
in fact!</p>

<p>Let no persecutor of the Jew lay the unction to his
soul that he is justified by the tragedy of Golgotha; for
he who persecutes in the name of religion is a spiritual
barbarian, an intellectual savage. Let this same persecutor
not make the mistake of supposing that the Jews
are wholly responsible for the persecution that has
been heaped upon them. Before he falls into the foolish
blunder of such a supposition, let him ponder the
testimony of several Gentile experts upon the subject.
Let him read "The Scattered Nation," a brilliant lecture
on the Jew by the late Zebulon Vance, of North
Carolina, in which occurs this sentence: "If the Jew
is a bad job, in all honesty we should contemplate him
as the handiwork of our own civilization." Let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
find Shakespearean confirmation of this statement in
"The Merchant of Venice," Act III, Scene i. If the
Jew-baiter objects that this is the imagination of a
poet, let us then point him to the testimony of a great
historian and statesman to prove to him that the Gentile
is in great measure responsible for the causes that
have produced Jewish persecution.</p>

<p>In the British House of Commons, on April 17,
1873, a bill for the removal of the disabilities of the
Jews was the subject of parliamentary discussion.
Lord Macaulay took part in the debate and spoke as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The honorable member for Oldham tells us that the Jews
are naturally a mean race, a money-getting race; that they
are averse to all honorable callings; that they neither sow
nor reap; that they have neither flocks nor herds; that
usury is the only pursuit for which they are fit; that they
are destitute of all elevated and amiable sentiments.</p>

<p>Such, sir, has in every age been the reasoning of bigots.
They never fail to plead in justification of persecution the
vices which persecution has engendered. England has been
legally a home to the Jews less than half a century, and we
revile them because they do not feel for England more than
a half patriotism.</p>

<p>We treat them as slaves, and wonder that they do not regard
us as brethren. We drive them to mean occupations,
and then reproach them for not embracing honorable professions.
We long forbade them to possess land, and we
complain that they chiefly occupy themselves in trade. We
shut them out from all the paths of ambition, and then we
despise them for taking refuge in avarice.</p>

<p>During many ages we have, in our dealings with them,
abused our immense superiority of force, and then we are
disgusted because they have recourse to that cunning which
to the natural and universal defence of the weak against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>violence of the strong. But were they always a mere money-changing,
money-getting, money-hoarding race? Nobody
knows better than my honorable friend, the member for the
University of Oxford, that there is nothing in their national
character which unfits them for the highest duties of citizens.</p>

<p>He knows that, in the infancy of civilization, when our
island was as savage as New Guinea, when letters and art
were still unknown to Athens, when scarcely a thatched hut
stood on what was afterwards the site of Rome, this contemned
people had their fenced cities and cedar palaces,
their splendid Temple, their fleets of merchant ships, their
schools of sacred learning, their great statesmen and soldiers,
their natural philosophers, their historians and their
poets.</p>

<p>What nation ever contended more manfully against
overwhelming odds for its independence and religion?
What nation ever, in its last agonies, gave such signal proofs
of what may be accomplished by a brave despair? And if,
in the course of many centuries, the depressed descendants of
warriors and sages have degenerated from the qualities of
their fathers; if, while excluded from the blessings of law
and bowed down under the yoke of slavery, they have contracted
some of the vices of outlaws and slaves, shall we
consider this is a matter of reproach to them? Shall we not
rather consider it as a matter of shame and remorse to ourselves?
Let us do justice to them. Let us open to them
the door of the House of Commons. Let us open to them
every career in which ability and energy can be displayed.
Till we have done this, let us not presume to say that there
is no genius among the countrymen of Isaiah, no heroism
among the descendants of the Maccabees.</p></div>

<p>If the persecutor of the Jew is not moved by the eloquence
of Macaulay or by the satire and sarcasm of
Shakespeare, then let him call the roll of Hebrew
great names and watch the mighty procession as it
moves. Abraham among patriarchs; Moses among
lawgivers; Isaiah and Jeremiah among prophets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Philo, Maimonides, Spinoza, and Mendelsohn among
philosophers; Herschel, Sylvester, Jacobi, and Kronecker
among mathematicians and astronomers; Josephus,
Neander, Graetz, Palgrave, and Geiger among
historians; Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer, Offenbach,
Goldmark, Joachim, Rubinstein, and Strauss among
musicians; Sonnenthal, Possart, Rachel, and Bernhardt
among actors and actresses; Disraeli, Gambetta,
Castelar, Lasker, Crémieux, and Benjamin among
statesmen; Halevi and Heine among poets; Karl
Marx and Samuel Gompers among labor leaders and
political economists; the Rothschilds, Bleichrörders,
Schiffs, and Seligmans among financiers; Auerbach
and Nordau among novelists; Sir Moses Montefiore
and Baron Hirsch among philanthropists!</p>

<p>But there are no Cæsars, no Napoleons, no Shakespeares,
no Aristotles among them, you say? Maybe
so; but what of that? Admitting that this is true, is
anything proved by the fact? These characters represented
mountain peaks of intellect, and were the isolated
products of different races and different centuries.
It may be justly observed that, of their kind, no
others were comparable to them. But if the "mountain-peak"
theory is to govern as to the intellectuality
of races, will it be seriously contended that any one of
the last-mentioned characters was equal in either spiritual
or intellectual grandeur to the Galilean peasant,
Jesus of Nazareth? If colossal forms of intellect and
soul be invoked, does not the Jew still lead the
universe?</p>

<p>Jesus was the most perfect product of Jewish spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
creation, the most precious gem of human life.
The most brilliant and civilized nations of the earth

<p>Both skeptics and believers of all ages have alike
pronounced His name with reverence and respect.
Even the flippant, sarcastic soul of Voltaire was awed,
softened and subdued by the sweetness of His life and
the majesty of His character.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Max Nordau betrays secret Jewish pride in Jesus
when he says: "Jesus is soul of our soul, even as he is
flesh of our flesh. Who, then, could think of excluding
him from the people of Israel? St. Peter will remain
the only Jew who has said of the Son of David, 'I
know not the man.' Putting aside the Messianic mission,
this man is ours. He honors our race, and we
claim him as we claim the Gospels&mdash;flowers of Jewish
literature and only Jewish."</p>

<p>"Is it a truth," asks Keim, "or is it nothing but
words, when this virtuous God-allied human life is
called the noblest blossom of a noble tree, the crown
of the cedar of Israel? A full vigorous life in a barren
time, a new building among ruins, an erect strong nature
among broken ones, a Son of God among the godless
and the God-forsaken, one who was joyous,
hopeful, generous among those who were mourning
and in despair, a freeman among slaves, a saint among
sinners&mdash;by this contradiction to the facts of the time,
by this gigantic exaltation above the depressed uniformity
of the century, by this compensation for stagnation,
retrogression, and the sickness of death in
progress, health, force and color of eternal youth&mdash;finally,
by the lofty uniqueness of what he achieved, of
his purity, of his God-nearness&mdash;he produces, even
with regard to endless new centuries that have <i>through
him</i> been saved from stagnation and retrogression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>the impression of mysterious solitariness, superhuman
miracle, divine creation."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>"Between Him and whoever else in the world," said
Napoleon at St. Helena, "there is no possible term of
comparison."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Throughout Napoleonic literature two names constantly
recur as exhibiting the Corsican's ideals of spiritual
and intellectual perfection. These names are
those of Jesus Christ and Julius Cæsar. Napoleon's
stupendous genius and incomprehensible destiny
formed the basis of a secret conviction within his soul
that with Jesus and Cæsar displaced, he himself would
be the grandest ornament of history. But in the mind
of the emperor there was no element of equality or
comparison between Jesus and Cæsar. The latter he
regarded as the crown and consummation of Roman
manhood, the most superb character of the ancient
world. The former he believed to be divine.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Napoleon while in exile at St.
Helena to converse almost daily about the illustrious
men of antiquity and to compare them with himself.
On one occasion while talking upon his favorite theme
with an officer, one of the companions of his exile, he
suddenly stopped and asked: "But can you tell me who
Jesus Christ was?" In reply, the officer candidly confessed
that he had never thought much about the
Nazarene. "Well, then," said Napoleon, "I will tell
you." The illustrious captive then compared Jesus
with the heroes of antiquity and finally with himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>The comparison demonstrated how paltry and contemptible
was everything human when viewed in the
light of the divine character and sublime achievements
of the Man of Nazareth. "I think I understand
somewhat of human nature," said Napoleon, "and I
tell you all these were men, and I am a man, but not
one is like Him; Jesus Christ was more than man.
Alexander, Cæsar, Charlemagne, and myself founded
great empires; but upon what did the creations of our
genius depend? Upon force. Jesus alone founded
His empire upon love, and to this very day millions
would die for Him."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>We have every reason to believe that the homage
paid the character of Jesus by Napoleon was not
merely the product of his brain, but was also the humble
tribute of his heart. When the disasters of the Russian
campaign broke upon his fortunes, when "the
infantry of the snow and the cavalry of the wild blast
scattered his legions like winter's withered leaves," the
iron-hearted, granite-featured man who had "conquered
the Alps and had mingled the eagles of France
with the eagles of the crags," only laughed and joked.
But, while contemplating the life and death of Jesus,
he became serious, meditative and humble. And when
he came to write his last will and testament, he made
this sentence the opening paragraph: "I die in the
Roman Catholic Apostolical religion, in the bosom of
which I was born more than fifty years ago."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>Christianity of Napoleon has been questioned. It is
respectfully submitted that only an ungenerous criticism
will attribute hypocrisy to this final testimony of
his religious faith. The imperial courage, the grandeur
of character, and the loftiness of life of the greatest
of the emperors negative completely the thought of
insincerity in a declaration made at a time when every
earthly inducement to misrepresentation had passed
forever.</p>

<p>But Jesus was not the Christ, the Savior of warrior-kings
alone, in the hour of death. On the battlefield
of Inkerman an humble soldier fell mortally wounded.
He managed to crawl to his tent before he died.
When found he was lying face downward with the
open Bible beside him. His right hand was glued
with his lifeblood to Chapter XI., Verse 25 of St.
John. When the hand was lifted, these words, containing
the ever-living promise of the Master, could
be clearly traced: "I am the resurrection and the life:
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live."</p>

<i><span class="hidden">E</span>XTENT of the Roman Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
at the Time of Christ.</i>&mdash;The policy
of ancient Rome was to extend
and hold her possessions by
force of arms. She made demands;
and if they were not
complied with, she spurned the
medium of diplomacy and appealed
for arbitrament to the
god of battles. Her achievements were the achievements
of war. Her glories were the glories of combat.
Her trophies were the treasures of conquered provinces
and chained captives bowed in grief and shame.
Her theory was that "might makes right"; and in
vindication and support of this theory she imbued her
youth with a martial spirit, trained them in the use of
arms from childhood to manhood, and stationed her
legions wherever she extended her empire. Thus, military
discipline and the fortune of successful warfare
formed the basis of the prosperity of Rome.</p>

<p>At the period of which we write, her invincible
legions had accomplished the conquest of the civilized
earth. Britain, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Illyria, Greece, Asia
Minor, Africa, Egypt, and the islands of the Mediterranean&mdash;six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
hundred thousand square leagues of the
most fertile territory in the world&mdash;had been subdued
to the Roman will and had become obedient to Roman
decrees. "The empire of the Romans," says Gibbon,
"filled the world, and when that empire fell into the
hands of a single person, the world became a safe and
dreary prison for his enemies. The slave of imperial
despotism, whether he was compelled to drag his
gilded chain in Rome and the Senate, or to wear out
a life of exile on the barren rock of Seriphus, or on
the frozen banks of the Danube, expected his fate in
silent despair. To resist was fatal, and it was impossible
to fly. On every side he was encompassed by a
vast extent of sea and land, which he could never hope
to traverse without being discovered, seized, and restored
to his irritated master. Beyond the frontiers,
his anxious view could discover nothing, except the
ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of barbarians,
of fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent
kings who would gladly purchase the emperor's
protection by the sacrifice of an obnoxious fugitive.
'Wherever you are,' said Cicero to the exiled Marcellus,
'remember that you are equally within the power
of the conqueror.'"</p>

<p>In obedience to a universal law of development and
growth, when the Roman empire had reached the limits
of physical expansion, when Roman conquest was
complete, when Roman laws and letters had reached
approximate perfection, and when Roman civilization
had attained its crown and consummation, Roman decline
began. The birth of the empire marked the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of the end. It was then that the shades of
night commenced to gather slowly upon the Roman
world; and that the Roman ship of state began to move
slowly but inevitably, upon a current of indescribable
depravity and degeneracy, toward the abyss. The
Roman giant bore upon his shoulders the treasures of
a conquered world; and Bacchus-like, reeled, crowned
and drunken, to his doom.</p>

<p>No period of human history is so marked by lust and
licentiousness as the history of Rome at the beginning
of the Christian era. The Roman religion had fallen
into contempt. The family instinct was dead, and the
marital relation was a mockery and a shame. The
humane spirit had vanished from Roman hearts, and
slavery was the curse of every province of the empire.
The destruction of infants and the gladiatorial games
were mere epitomes of Roman brutality and degeneracy.
Barbarity, corruption and dissoluteness pervaded
every form of Roman life.</p>

<p>A perfect picture of the depravity of the times about
which we write may be had from a perusal of the
Roman satirists, Tacitus and Juvenal. The ordinary
Roman debauchee was not the sole victim of their
wrath. They chiseled the hideous features of the
Cæsars with a finer stroke than that employed by
Phidias and Praxiteles in carving statues of the Olympic
gods.</p>

<p>The purpose of Part II of this volume is to give coloring
and atmosphere to the picture of the trial and
crucifixion of Jesus by describing: (1) The Græco-Roman
religion; and (2) the Græco-Roman social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
life, during the century preceding and the century following
the birth of the Savior.</p>

<h4>1.&mdash;THE GRÆCO-ROMAN RELIGION</h4>

<p><i>Origin and Multiplicity of the Roman Gods.</i>&mdash;The
Romans acquired their gods by inheritance, by importation,
and by manufacture. The Roman race sprang
from a union of Etruscans, Latins, and Sabines; and
the gods of these different tribes, naturalized and
adopted, were the first deities of Rome. Chief among
them were Janus, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Other
early Roman deities were Sol, the Sun, and Luna the
Moon, both of Sabine origin; Mater Matuta, Mother
of Day; Divus Pater Tiberinus, or Father Tiber; Fontus,
the god of fountains; Vesta, the goddess of the
hearth; and the Lares and Penates, household gods.</p>

<p>These primitive Italian divinities were at first
mere abstractions, simple nature-powers; but later they
were Hellenized and received plastic form. The
Greeks and Romans had a common ancestry and the
amalgamation of their religions was an easy matter.
The successive steps in the process of blending the two
forms of worship are historical. From Cumæ, one of
the oldest Greek settlements in Italy, the famous Sibylline
books found their way to Rome; and through these
books the Greek gods and their worship established
themselves in Italy. The date of the arrival of several
of the Hellenic deities is well ascertained. The first
temple to Apollo was vowed in the year 351 <span class="small">A.U.C.</span> To
check a lingering epidemic of pestilence and disease,
the worship of Æsculapius was introduced from Epidaurus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
into Rome in the year 463. In 549, Cybele,
the Idæan mother, was imported from Phrygia, in the
shape of a black stone, and was worshiped at Rome by
order of the Sibylline books.</p>

<p>In various ways, the Hellenization of the Roman
religion was accomplished. The Decemviri, to whom
the consulting of the Sibylline books was intrusted, frequently
interpreted them to mean that certain foreign
gods should be invited at once to take up their residence
in Rome.</p>

<p>The introduction of Greek literature also resulted in
the importation of Greek gods. The tragedies of
Livius Andronicus and the comedies of Nævius,
founded upon Greek legends of gods and heroes, were
presented in Rome in the later years of the third century
<span class="small">B.C.</span> Fragments of Greek literature also began to
make their way into the Capital about this time.
Philosophers, rhetoricians, and grammarians flocked
from Greece to Italy and brought with them the works
of Homer, Hesiod and the Greek philosophers, whose
writings were permeated with Greek mythology.</p>

<p>Grecian sculpture was as potent as Grecian literature
in transforming and Hellenizing the religion of
Rome. The subjugation of the Greek colonies in the
south of Italy and the conquests of Greek cities like
Syracuse and Corinth in the East, brought together in
Rome the masterpieces of the Greek sculptors.</p>

<p>A determined effort was made from time to time by
the patriotic Romans to destroy Hellenic influence and
to preserve in their original purity early Roman forms
of worship. But all attempts were futile. The average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Roman citizen, though practical and unimaginative,
was still enamored of the beautiful myths and exquisite
statues of the Greek gods. And it was only by
Hellenizing their own deities that they could bring
themselves into touch and communion with the Hellenic
spirit. The æsthetical and fascinating influence
of the Greek language, literature and sculpture, was
overwhelming. "At bottom, the Roman religion was
based only on two ideas&mdash;the might of the gods who
were friendly to Rome, and the power of the ceremonies
over the gods. How could a religion, so poverty-stricken
of thought, with its troops of phantom gods,
beingless shadows and deified abstractions, remain unscathed
and unaltered when it came in contact with
the profusion of the Greek religion, with its circle of
gods, so full of life, so thoroughly anthropomorphised,
so deeply interwoven into everything human?"<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Not only from Greece but from every conquered
country, strange gods were brought into Italy and
placed in the Roman pantheon. When a foreign city
was besieged and captured, the Romans, after a preliminary
ceremony, invited the native gods to leave
their temples and go to Rome where, they were assured,
they would have much grander altars and would
receive a more enthusiastic worship. It was a religious
belief of the ancient masters of the world that
gods could be enticed from their allegiance and
induced to emigrate. In their foreign wars, the Romans
frequently kept the names of their own gods
secret to prevent the enemy from bribing them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>
<p>The gods at Rome increased in number just in proportion
that the empire expanded. The admission of
foreign territory brought with it the introduction of
strange gods into the Roman worship.</p>

<p>When the Romans needed a new god and could not
find a foreign one that pleased them, they deliberately
manufactured a special deity for the occasion. In the
breaking up and multiplication of the god-idea, they
excelled all the nations of antiquity. It was the duty
of the pontiffs to manufacture a divinity whenever an
emergency arose and one was needed. The god-casting
business was a regular employment of the Decemviri
and the Quindecemviri; and a perusal of the
pages of Roman history reveals these god-makers
actively engaged in their workshops making some
new deity to meet some new development in Roman
life.</p>

<p>The extent of the polytheistic notions of the ancient
Romans is almost inconceivable to the modern mind.
Not only were the great forces of nature deified, but
the simplest elements of time, of thought, and action.
Ordinary mental abstractions were clothed with the
attributes of gods. Mens (Mind), Pudicitia (Chastity),
Pietas (Piety), Fides (Fidelity), Concordia
(Concord), Virtus (Courage), Spes (Hope), and
Voluptas (Pleasure), were all deities of the human
soul, and were enthusiastically worshiped by the Romans.
A single human action was frequently broken
into parts each of which had a little god of its own.
The beginning of a marriage had one deity and its
conclusion, another. Cunina was the cradle-goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of a child. Statilinus, Edusa, Potnia, Paventia, Fabelinus
and Catius were other goddesses who presided
over other phases of its infancy. Juventas was
the goddess of its youth; and, in case of loss of
parents, Orbona was the goddess that protected its
orphanage.</p>

<p>Any political development in the Roman state necessitated
a new divinity to mark the change. In the
early periods of their history, the Romans used cattle
as a medium of exchange in buying and bartering.
Pecunia was then the goddess of such exchange. But
when, in later times, copper money came into use, a
god called Æsculanus was created to preside over the
finances; and when, still later, silver money began to
be used, the god Argentarius was called into being to
protect the coinage. This Argentarius was naturally
the son of Æsculanus.</p>

<p>Not only the beneficent but the malign forces of nature
were deified. Pests, plagues, and tempests had
their special divinities who were to be placated.
"There were particular gods for every portion of a
dwelling&mdash;the door, the threshold of the door, and
even the hinges of the door. There was a special god
for each different class&mdash;even the most menial and the
most immoral; and a special divinity for those who
were afflicted in a peculiar manner, such as the childless,
the maimed or the blind. There was the god of
the stable, and the goddess of the horses; there were
gods for merchants, artists, poets and tillers of the soil.
The gods must be invoked before the harvest could be
reaped; and not even a tree could be felled in the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
without supplicating the unknown god who might
inhabit it."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The extreme of the Roman divinity-making process
was the deification of mere negative ideas. Tranquillitas
Vacuna was the goddess of "doing nothing."</p>

<p>Not only were special actions and peculiar ideas
broken up and subdivided with an appropriate divinity
for each part or subdivision, but the individual
gods themselves were subdivided and multiplied. It is
said that there were three hundred Jupiters in Rome.
This means that Jupiter was worshiped under three
hundred different forms. Jupiter Pluvius, Jupiter
Fulgurator, Jupiter Tonans, Jupiter Fulminator, Jupiter
Imbricitor, Jupiter Serenator, were only a few
designations of the supreme deity of the Romans.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that polytheism was insatiable
in its thirst for new and strange gods. When the god-casting
business was once begun, there was no end to
it. And when the Roman empire had reached its
greatest expansion, and Roman public and private life
had attained to complete development, the deities of
the Roman religion were innumerable. No pantheon
could hold them, and no Roman could remember the
names of all. Temples of the gods were everywhere
to be found throughout the empire; and where there
were no altars or temples, certain trees, stones and
rocks were decorated with garlands and worshiped as
sacred places which the gods were supposed to frequent.
Thus the Roman world became crowded with
holy places, and the gods and goddesses became an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>innumerable host. Petronius makes a countrywoman
from a district adjoining Rome declare that it was
much easier to find a god in her neighborhood than a
man. We shall see that the multiplicity of the gods
was finally the cause of the decay and ruin of the
Roman religion.</p>

<p><i>The Roman Priesthood.</i>&mdash;The Roman priesthood
was composed of several orders of pontiffs, augurs,
keepers of the Sibylline books, Vestal virgins, epulos,
salians, lupercals, etc.</p>

<p>Fifteen pontiffs exercised supreme control in matters
of religion. They were consecrated to the service of
the gods; and all questions of doubtful religious interpretation
were submitted to the judgment of their
tribunal.</p>

<p>Fifteen learned and experienced augurs observed
the phenomena of nature and studied the flight of birds
as a means of directing the actions of the state.</p>

<p>Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books read the pages
of their treasures and from them divined coming
events.</p>

<p>Six Vestals, immaculate in their virginity, guarded
the Roman sacred fire, and presided at the national
hearthstone of the Roman race.</p>

<p>Seven epulos conducted the solemn processions and
regulated the religious ceremonies at the annual festivals
of the gods.</p>

<p>Fifteen flamens were consecrated to the service of
separate deities. Those of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus
were held in the highest esteem. The Flamen
Dialis, or priest of Jupiter, was loaded down with religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
obligations and restrictions. He was not permitted
to take an oath, to ride, to have anything tied
with knots on his person, to look at a prisoner, see
armed men, or to touch a dog, a goat, or raw flesh, or
yeast. He was not allowed to bathe in the open air;
nor could he spend the night outside the city. He
could resign his office only on the death of his wife.
The Salians were priests of Mars, who, at festivals
celebrated in honor of the war-god, danced in heavy
armor, and sang martial hymns.</p>

<p><i>Roman Forms of Worship.</i>&mdash;Roman worship was
very elaborate and ceremonial. It consisted of sacrifices,
vows, prayers, and festivals. With the exception
of the ancient Hebrews, the Romans were the greatest
formalists and ritualists of antiquity. Every act of
Roman public and private life was supposed to be
framed in accordance with the will of the gods.
There was a formula of prayer adapted to every vicissitude
of life. Cæsar never mounted his chariot, it is
said, that he did not repeat a formula three times to
avert dangers.</p>

<p>A painful exactness in the use of words was required
in the offering of a Roman prayer. A syllable left out
or a word mispronounced, or the intervention of any
disturbing cause of evil import, would destroy the
merit of the formula. The Romans believed that the
voice of prayer should not be interrupted by noises or
bad omens. And that the sound of evil augury might
not be heard at the moment of supplication, they were
in the habit of covering their ears. Musical notes of
favorable import were not objectionable, and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
flutes were played while the prayer was being
offered to chase away disturbing sounds. At other
times, the priests had special assistants whose duty it
was to maintain silence during the recital of the formula.
But, if the ceremony was successful, if the language
had been correctly pronounced, without the
omission or addition of a word; if all disturbing causes
and things of evil omen had been alienated from the
services, then the granting of the prayer was assured,
regardless of the motive or intention of the person
praying. It should be remembered that piety and
faith were not necessary to the efficacy of Roman
prayer. Ceremonial precision, rather than purity of
heart, was pleasing to the Roman gods. A peculiar
element entered into the religions of both the ancient
Romans and the ancient Hebrews. It was the principle
of contract in an almost purely juristic sense.
Both the Romans and the Hebrews believed that if
the divine law was obeyed to the letter, their deities
were under the strictest obligation to grant their
petitions.</p>

<p>Under the Roman form of worship, a peculiar act
of supplication was performed by the suppliant who
kissed his right hand, turned round in a circle by the
right, and then seated himself upon the ground. This
was done in obedience to one of the laws of Numa.
The circular movement of the earth, it was thought,
was symbolized by the turning round in a circle; and
the sitting down indicated that the suppliant was confidant
that his prayer would be granted.</p>

<p>The Romans believed that prayers were more efficacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
if said in the immediate presence and, if possible,
in actual contact with the image of the god. The
doorkeepers of the temple were frequently besieged by
suppliants who begged to be admitted into the inclosures
of the sacred places where they might pray to the
deity on the spot.</p>

<p>On account of the vast numbers of the gods, the
Romans were sometimes at a loss to know which one to
address in prayer. Unlike the Greeks, they had no
preferences among their deities. Each was supplicated
in his turn according to the business in hand.
But they were frequently in doubt as to the name of
the god who had control of the subject-matter of their
petitions. In such cases, the practical genius of the
Roman people served them well. They had recourse
to several expedients which they believed would insure
success. When in doubt as to the particular divinity
which they should address in supplication, they would,
at times, invoke, in the first place, Janus, the god of all
good beginnings, the doorkeeper, so to speak, of the
pantheon, who, it was believed, would deliver the
prayer to the proper deity. At other times, in such
perplexity, they would address their petitions to a
group of gods in which they knew the right one was
bound to be. It sometimes happened that they did not
know whether the deity to be supplicated was a god or
goddess. In such an emergency, they expressed themselves
very cautiously, using the alternative proviso:
"Be thou god or goddess." At other times, in cases of
extreme doubt, they prayed to all the deities at once;
and often, in fits of desperation, they dismissed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
entire pantheon and addressed their prayers to the
Unknown God.</p>

<p>Another mode of propitiating the gods was by sacrifice.
Animals, the fruits of the fields, and even human
beings were devoted to this purpose. In the matter of
sacrifice, the practical genius of the Roman people was
again forcibly manifested. They were tactful enough
to adapt the sacrifice to the whims and tastes of the
gods. A provision of the Twelve Tables was that
"such beasts should be used for victims as were becoming
and agreeable to each deity." The framers of
these laws evidently believed that the gods had keenly
whetted appetites and discriminating tastes in the matter
of animal sacrifice. Jupiter Capitolinus was
pleased with an offering of white cattle with gilded
horns, but would not accept rams or bulls. Mars,
Neptune and Apollo were, on the other hand, highly
delighted with the sacrifice of bulls. It was also
agreeable to Mars to have horses, cocks, and asses sacrificed
in his honor. An intact heifer was always
pleasing to the goddess Minerva. A white cow with
moon-shaped horns delighted Juno Calendaris. A
sow in young was sacrificed to the great Mother; and
doves and sparrows to Venus. Unweaned puppies
were offered as victims of expiation to the Lares and
Penates. Black bulls were usually slaughtered to appease
the infernal gods.</p>

<p>The most careful attention was given to the selection
of the victims of sacrifice from the flocks and herds.
Any serious physical defect in the animal disqualified.
A calf was not fit for slaughter if its tail did not reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
to the joint of the leg. Sheep with cloven tongues and
black ears were rejected. Black spots on a white ox
had to be rubbed white with chalk before the beast was
available for sacrifice.</p>

<p>Not only animals were sacrificed, but human beings
as well, to appease the wrath of the gods in time of
awful calamity. In early Roman history, gray-headed
men of sixty years were hurled from the Pons Sublicius
into the Tiber as an offering to Saturn. In the year
227 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the pontiffs discovered from the Sibylline
books that the Gauls and Greeks were to attack and
capture the city. To fulfill the prophecy and, at the
same time to avert the danger, the senate decreed that
a man and woman of each of these two nations should
be buried alive in the forum as a form of constructive
possession. This was nothing but a human sacrifice
to the gods.</p>

<p>Again, two of Cæsar's soldiers, who had participated
in a riot in Rome, were taken to the Campus Martius
and sacrificed to Mars by the pontiffs and the Flamen
Martialis. Their heads were fixed upon the Regia, as
was the case in the sacrifice of the October-horse. As
an oblation to Neptune, Sextus Pompeius had live men
and horses thrown into the sea at the time when a great
storm was destroying the fleet of the enemy.</p>

<p>A near approach to human sacrifice was the custom
of sprinkling the statue of Jupiter Latiaris with the
blood of gladiators. A priest caught the blood as it
gushed from the wound of the dying gladiator, and
dashed it while still warm at the face of the image of
the god.</p>

<p>Suetonius tells us that after the capture of Perugia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Augustus Cæsar slaughtered three hundred prisoners
as an expiatory sacrifice to Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>Thus at the beginning of the Christian era, human
beings were still being sacrificed on the altars of superstition.</p>

<p><i>Ascertaining the Will of the Gods.</i>&mdash;Various methods
were employed by the Romans in ascertaining the
will of the gods. Chief among these were the art of
divination from the flight of birds and from the inspection
of the entrails of animals; also from the observation
of lightning and the interpretation of
dreams. The Romans had no oracles like those of the
Greeks, but they frequently sent messengers to consult
the Delphic oracle.</p>

<p>Nothing is stranger or more disgusting in all the
range of religious history than the practice of the
Roman haruspices. That the ancient masters of the
world should have felt themselves obliged to search in
the belly of a beast for the will of Jupiter is one of the
abominable enigmas of Pagan superstition. The inspection
of the entrails of victims was a Tuscan
science, early imported from Etruria, and naturalized
at Rome. Tuscan haruspices accompanied the Roman
armies everywhere, and determined by their skill
whether a battle should be fought or a retreat ordered.
When it was doubtful what to do, an animal was
slaughtered, and the heart, lungs, liver, tongue, spleen,
kidneys and caul were closely inspected with the aid
of a small needle or knife. Various conditions and appearances
of these parts were considered as signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the pleasure or disfavor of the gods. Largely developed
veins on the adverse side were considered tokens
of extreme displeasure and an indication of pending
misfortune. It was also considered gravely ominous
when the head or protuberance in the right lobe of the
liver was wanting. The Romans were too practical
and indomitable, however, to allow a single bad omen
to frustrate a great enterprise. If the inspection of the
entrails of the first animal was not favorable, they
slaughtered still others until a propitious sign was observed.
At times, a score of beasts were slain before
the gods gave assent to the enterprise in hand.</p>

<p>Divination from the flight and notes of birds was
another method employed by the Romans in finding
out the will of the gods. And it may be remarked that
this was certainly a more rational and elevated form
of divination than that which we have just discussed.
An eagle swooping down from the skies would certainly
be a more natural and pleasing suggestion of
the thoughts and attributes of Jove than the filthy interior
of the entrails of a bull.</p>

<p>The elements of divination from the flight of birds
were derived either from the significant notes and
sounds of their voices, or from the manner in which
their wings were flapped or their flight conducted. If
the bird flew from the left to the right of the augur,
it was considered a happy omen; if the flight was in
the opposite direction, the enterprise in hand had to
be abandoned or at least delayed. Augury by flight
was usually applied to eagles and vultures, while
woodpeckers, ravens, crows, and screech owls announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the will of the gods by note. The direction
from which the note came, usually determined the
nature of the augury. But, in the case of the screech owl,
the sounds were always of evil omen, from whatever
side they came. And those who have been so unfortunate
as to hear its mournful, desolate and God-forsaken
tones will not be disposed to censure either
the Romans or their gods for the low esteem in which
they held this bird.</p>

<p>Again, it was a principle of Roman augury that
auspices could be neutralized or overcome. If a crow
furnished an omen, and an eagle gave another which
was opposed to it, the first sign was wiped out, because
the eagle was a larger and nobler bird than the crow.
And, as in the case of prayer, so also in the matter of
the auspices, a disturbing sound would destroy the
effect of the augury. The squeak or cry of a mouse
would destroy a message from Jupiter conveyed in the
scream of an eagle.</p>

<p>But the most potent manifestation of the divine
mind, among the ancient Romans, was that derived
from thunder and lightning. Lightning to them was
the sovereign expression of the will of the gods; and
a single flash blotted out every other sign and token.
It was an irrevocable presage and could not be remotely
modified or evaded. It came directly from the
hand of the deity and was an emphatic revelation of
the divine mind. All places struck by lightning were
considered sacred and were consecrated to the god who
had sent the bolt. Upon the spot where it fell, an altar
was raised and an inclosure formed. The service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
consecration consisted in burying the lightning, that
is, in restoring the earth thrown up by it, and in the
sacrifice of a two-year-old sheep. All such places were
considered hallowed spots and it was impious and sacrilegious
to touch them or even look at them. The
gods deprived of reason those who destroyed the altars
and sacred inclosures of these places.</p>

<p>These various methods of ascertaining the will of
the deities were employed in every important transaction
of Roman public and private life. At times, all
of them coöperated on occasions of vast import and
when the lives and destinies of great men were
involved.</p>

<p>The following single paragraph from Suetonius
contains allusions to all the modes of divination which
we have just discussed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After the death of Cæsar, upon his return from Apollonia
as he was entering the city, on a sudden, in a clear and
bright sky a circle resembling the rainbow surrounded the
body of the sun; and immediately afterwards, the tomb of
Julia, Cæsar's daughter, was struck by lightning. In his
first consulship whilst he was observing the auguries, twelve
vultures presented themselves as they had done to Romulus.
And when he offered sacrifice, the livers of all the victims
were folded inward in the lower part; a circumstance which
was regarded by those present, who had skill in things of
that nature, as an indubitable prognostic of great and wonderful
fortune.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p></div>

<p>The interpretation of dreams also formed an important
part in the determination of the will of the
gods, not only among the Romans, but among all ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>nations. The literature of antiquity, both sacred
and profane, is filled with dreams. Whether the biographer
is Matthew or Plutarch, dreams appear on the
pages of both. Chrysippus made a collection of
prophetical dreams in order to explain their meaning.
Both Galen and Hippocrates believed that dreams
were sent by the gods to men. Artemidorus wrote a
treatise on the subject, and in it he assures us that it
was compiled at the express bidding and under the
direction of Apollo himself.</p>

<p>It was in a dream that Joseph was warned not to put
away Mary his wife.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> It was also in a dream that an
angel voice warned him to flee into Egypt with the
infant Savior to escape the murderous designs of
Herod.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Nearly every great event, both in Greek and
Roman history, seems to have been heralded or attended
by dreams. The following account is given by
Suetonius of the dreams of Quintus Catulus and Marcus
Cicero presaging the reign of Augustus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Quintus Catulus had a dream, for two nights successively
after his dedication of the Capitol. The first night he dreamt
that Jupiter out of several boys of the order of the nobility
who were playing about his altar, selected one, into whose
bosom he put the public seal of the commonwealth, which he
held in his hand; but in his vision the next night, he saw in
the bosom of Jupiter Capitolinus, the same boy; whom he
ordered to be removed, but it was forbidden by the God, who
declared that it must be brought up to become the guardian
of the state. The next day, meeting Augustus, with whom
till that hour he had not the least acquaintance, and looking
at him with admiration, he said he was extremely like the
boy he had seen in his dream. Some gave a different account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>of Catulus's first dream, namely that Jupiter, upon
several noble lads requesting of him that they might have a
guardian, had pointed to one amongst them, to whom they
were to prefer their requests; and putting his fingers to the
boy's mouth to kiss, he afterwards applied them to his own.</p>

<p>Marcus Cicero, as he was attending Caius Cæsar to the
Capitol, happened to be telling some of his friends a dream
which he had the preceding night, in which he saw a comely
youth let down from heaven by a golden chain, who stood
at the door of the Capitol, and had a whip put into his
hands by Jupiter. And immediately upon sight of Augustus,
who had been sent for by his uncle Cæsar to the sacrifice,
and was as yet perfectly unknown to most of the company,
he affirmed that it was the very boy he had seen in his dream.
When he assumed the manly toga, his senatorian tunic becoming
loose in the seam on each side, fell at his feet. Some
would have this to forebode, that the order of which that
was the badge of distinction, would some time or other be
subject to him.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p></div>

<p>Omens also played an important rôle in molding the
destiny of the Roman state. In his "Life of Cæsar
Augustus," Suetonius says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some signs and omens he regarded as infallible. If in
the morning, his shoe was put on wrong, the left instead of
the right, that boded some disaster. If when he commenced
a long journey, by land or sea, there happened to fall a
mizzling rain, he held it to be a good sign of a speedy and
happy return. He was much affected likewise with anything
out of the common course of nature. A palm-tree which
chanced to grow up between some stones in the court of his
house, he transplanted into a court where the images of the
Household Gods were placed, and took all possible care to
make it thrive. In the island of Capri, some decayed
branches of an old ilex, which hung drooping to the ground,
recovered themselves upon his arrival; at which he was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>delighted, that he made an exchange with the Republic of
Naples, of the Island of Ischia, for that of Capri. He likewise
observed certain days; as never to go from home the
day after the Numdinæ, nor to begin any serious business
upon the nones; avoiding nothing else in it, as he writes to
Tiberius, than its unlucky name.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p></div>

<p>Any unusual happening and all the striking phenomena
of nature were regarded by the Romans as
prodigies or omens indicative of the will of the gods.
The nature of the occurrence indicated the pleasure
or the wrath of the deity. An eclipse of the sun and
the moon, a shooting star, a rainbow of peculiar color,
showers of stones and ashes, were regarded as awful
prodigies, and generally threw the Roman Senate into
a panic. On such occasions, the pontifical college
called a hurried meeting. The augurs and haruspices
were summoned to immediate duty; and everything
was done to ascertain the will of the gods and to do
their bidding. A two-headed snake or a three-legged
chicken, such as we frequently see to-day, would have
shaken the whole Roman religious system to the center.</p>

<p>Such was the credulity of the Roman people, that
the most improbable and impossible stories, mere rumors
born of lying imposture, were heard and believed.
"Idols shed tears or sweated blood, oxen
spoke, men were changed into women, cocks into hens,
lakes or brooks ran with blood or milk, mice nibbled
at the golden vessels of the temples, a swarm of bees
lighted on a temple or in a public place." All such
alleged occurrences required sacrifices and expiatory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>rites to conquer the fury and regain the favor of the
gods.</p>

<p><i>Fall of the Early Roman Religion.</i>&mdash;At the beginning
of the Christian era, the old Roman religion,
founded upon the institutions of Numa, had almost
come to an end. The invasion of Italy by the Greek
gods was the first serious assault upon the early Roman
faith. The elegant refinement and fascinating influence
of Greek literature, philosophy and sculpture,
had incrusted with a gorgeous coating the rude forms
of the primitive Roman worship. But, as time advanced,
the old gods grew stale and new deities were
sought. The human soul could not forever feed upon
myths, however brilliant and bewitching. The mysterious
and melancholy rites of Isis came to establish
themselves by the side of those of Janus and Æsculapius.
The somber qualities of the Egyptian worship
seemed to commend it. Even so good and grand a man
as Marcus Aurelius avowed himself an adorer of
Serapis; and, during a sojourn in Egypt, he is reported
to have conducted himself like an Egyptian citizen
and philosopher while strolling through the temples
and sacred groves on the banks of the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The effect of the repeated changes from one form
of religious faith to another was to gradually destroy
the moral fiber of Roman worship and to shatter
Roman faith in the existence and stability of the gods.
The first manifestation of that disintegration which
finally completely undermined and destroyed the temple
of Roman worship was the familiarity with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>the Romans treated their gods. Familiarity with gods,
as with men, breeds contempt. A striking peculiarity
of both the Roman and Greek mythologies was the intimate
relationship that existed between gods and
human beings. Sometimes it took the form of personal
intercourse from which heroes sprang, as was the case
with Jupiter and Alcmene, of whom Hercules was
born. At other times, deities and human beings traveled
together on long voyages, as was the case with
Minerva and Telemachus on their trip to the island
of Calypso. These were instances of what the Greeks
regarded as that natural and sympathetic relationship
that not only could but should exist between them and
their divinities. But in time the Romans entered upon
a career of frivolous fellowship and familiarity with
their gods which destroyed their mutual respect, and
hastened the dissolution of the bonds that had hitherto
held them together. They began to treat their divinities
as men, deserving of honor indeed, but nevertheless
human beings with all the frailties and attributes
of mortals. "Arnobius speaks of morning serenades
sung with an accompaniment of fifes, as a kind of
reveille to the sleeping gods, and of an evening salutation,
in which leave was taken of the deity with the
wishing him a good night's rest."</p>

<p>The Lectisternia or banquets of the gods were ordinary
religious functions to which the deities themselves
were invited. These feasts were characterized at times
by extreme exclusiveness. It was not right, thought
the Romans, to degrade and humiliate the greater gods
by seating them at the banquet board with smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
ones. So, a right royal fête was annually arranged in
the Capitol in honor of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.
The statue of the great god was placed reclining on a
pillow; and the images of the two goddesses were
seated upon chairs near him. At other times, the functions
were more democratic, and great numbers of the
gods were admitted, as well as a few select and distinguished
mortals. On such occasions, the images of the
gods were placed in pairs on cushions near the table.
The Romans believed that the spirit of the god actually
inhabited or occupied the statue. This we learn
from Lucian. The happy mortals who were fortunate
enough to be present at the banquet, actually believed
that they were seated among the gods. Livy tells us
that once the gods turned on their cushions and reversed
themselves at the table, and that mice then came
and devoured the meats.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The Roman historians very seriously inform us that
special invitations were extended the gods to attend
these banquets. They fail to tell us, however, whether
R.S.V.P. or any other directions were inserted in the
cards of invitation. We are left completely in the
dark as to the formality employed by the deities to
indicate their acceptance or rejection of the proffered
honor.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Lectisternia was at first undoubtedly
to promote hospitality and fellowship, and to conciliate
the good will of the gods. But finally such
intimacy ripened into contempt and all kinds of indecencies
began to be practiced against the deities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>Speaking of the actions of certain Romans, Seneca
says: "One sets a rival deity by the side of another
god; another shows Jupiter the time of day; this one
acts the beadle, the other the anointer, pretending by
gesture to rub in the ointment. A number of coiffeurs
attend upon Juno and Minerva, and make pretence of
curling with their fingers, not only at a distance from
their images, but in the actual temple. Some hold the
looking-glass to them; some solicit the gods to stand
security for them; while others display briefs before
them, and instruct them in their law cases." This rude
conduct was practiced by men. But Seneca, continuing,
says: "Women, too, take their seats at the Capitol
pretending that Jupiter is enamored of them, and not
allowing themselves to be intimidated by Juno's presence."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p><i>Roman Skepticism.</i>&mdash;Of contempt of the gods,
which was due to many causes, skepticism was born.
The deities of every race had been brought to Rome
and placed in the pantheon; and there, gazing into
each other's faces, had destroyed each other. The multiplicity
of the gods was the chief agency in the destruction
of the Roman faith and ritual. The yoke
and burden of endless ceremonials had been borne for
centuries and were now producing intolerable irritation
and nauseating disgust. The natural freedom of
the soul was in open rebellion and revolt against the
hollow forms and rigid exactions of the Roman ritual.
The eagle of the human intellect was already preparing
to soar above the clouds of superstition. Cicero
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
gave expression to the prevalent sentiments of educated
Romans of his day when he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I thought I should be doing an immense benefit both
to myself and to my countrymen if I could entirely eradicate
all superstitious errors. Nor is there any fear that true
religion can be endangered by the demolition of this superstition;
for as this religion which is united with the knowledge
of nature is to be propagated, so, also, are all the roots
of superstition to be destroyed; for that presses upon and
pursues and persecutes you wherever you turn yourself,
whether you consult a diviner or have heard an omen or
have immolated a victim, or beheld a flight of birds;
whether you have seen a Chaldæan or a soothsayer; if it
lightens or thunders, or if anything is struck by lightning;
if any kind of prodigy occurs; some of which things must
be frequently coming to pass, so that you can never rise with
a tranquil mind.</p></div>

<p>The completion of Roman conquest in the reign of
Augustus was another potent influence in the destruction
of the old Roman religion. The chief employment
of the Roman gods had ever been as servants of
the Roman state in the extension of the Roman empire.
Their services were now no longer needed in this regard,
and their ancient worshipers were ready to repudiate
and dismiss them. The Hebrew characteristic of
humility and resignation in the presence of divine
displeasure was not a Roman trait. The ancient masters
of the world reserved the right to object and even
to rebel when the gods failed to do their duty after
appropriate prayers had been said and proper ceremonies
had been performed. Sacrilege, as the result of
disappointment, was a frequent occurrence in Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
religious life. Bitter defiance of the heavenly powers
sometimes followed a defeat in battle or a failure in
diplomacy. Augustus, as supreme pontiff, chastised
Neptune, the god of the sea, because he lost his fleet
in a storm, by forbidding the image of the god to be
carried in the procession of the next Circensian games.
The emperor Julian was regarded as a most pious potentate,
but he did not hesitate to defy the gods when
he became displeased. At the time of the Parthian
war, he was preparing to sacrifice ten select and beautiful
bulls to Mars the Avenger, when nine of them
suddenly lay down while being led to the altar, and
the tenth broke his band. The fury of the monarch
was aroused, and he swore by Jupiter that he would
not again offer a sacrifice to Mars.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Claudius, the
commander of the Roman fleet at Drepanum, ordered
the sacred pullets to be thrown into the sea because
they would not eat. When Germanicus was sick in
Asia, his devoted admirers offered frequent prayers to
the gods for his recovery. When the report of his
death reached Rome, the temples of the unaccommodating
deities were stoned, and their altars were overturned.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The same feeling of angry resentment and defiance
may be discerned in inscriptions on the graves of relatives
prematurely snatched away by death. An epitaph
on the monument of a child of five years was this:
"To the unrighteous gods who robbed me of my life."
Another on the tombstone of a maiden of twenty,
named Procope, read as follows: "I lift my hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>against the god who has deprived me of my innocent
existence."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The soil of familiarity, contempt and sacrilege
which we have just described, was most fertile ground
for the growth of that rank and killing skepticism
which was destroying the vitals of the Roman faith at
the time of Christ. This unbelief, it is true, was not
universal. At the time of the birth of the Savior, the
Roman masses still believed in the gods and goddesses
of the Greek and Roman mythologies. Superstition
was especially prevalent in the country districts of both
Greece and Italy. Pausanias, who lived about the
middle of the second century of the Christian era, tells
as that in his time the olden legends of god and hero
were still firmly believed by the common people. As
he traveled through Greece, the cypresses of Alcmæon,
the stance of Amphion, and the ashes of the funeral
piles of Niobe's children were pointed out to him. In
Phocis, he found the belief still existing that larks laid
no eggs there because of the sin of Tereus.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Plutarch,
who lived about the middle of the first century of our
era, tells us that the people were still modeling the
gods in wax and clay, as well as carving them in marble
and were worshiping them in contempt and defiance
of philosophers and statesmen.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> But this credulity
was limited to the ignorant and unthinking masses.
The intellectual leaders of both the Greek and Roman
races had long been in revolt against the absurdity and
vulgarity of the myths which formed the foundation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>of their popular faiths. The purity and majesty of the
soul felt keenly the insult and outrage of enforced
obedience to the obscene divinities that Homer and
Hesiod had handed down to them. Five hundred
years before Christ, Pindar, the greatest lyric poet of
Greece, had denounced the vulgar tales told of the
deities, and had branded as blasphemous the story of
the cannibal feast spread for the gods by the father of
Pelops. Xenophanes, also, in the sixth century before
Christ, had ridiculed the mythical tales of the Homeric
poems, and had called attention to the purely human
character of popular religions. He had pointed out
that the Ethiopians painted the images of their deities
black, and gave them flat noses, in the likeness of themselves;
that the Thracians, on the other hand, created
their gods blue-eyed and red; and that, in general,
every race had reflected its own physical peculiarities
in the creation of its gods. He declared it to be his
opinion that if the beasts of the field should attempt
to produce a likeness of the gods, the horses would produce
a resemblance of themselves, and that oxen and
lions would ascribe to their own divinities their own
images and peculiarities.</p>

<p>The whole structure of the Roman religion, built
upon myths and adorned with fables, was ill fitted to
stand the tests of analysis and criticism. It was destined
to weaken and crumble the moment it was subjected
to serious rational inquiry. Such inquiry was
inevitable in the progress of that soul-growth which
the centuries were sure to bring. Natural philosophy
and historical study began to dissolve the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
legends and to demand demonstration and proof
where faith had before sufficed. Skeptical criticism
began to dissect the formulæ of prayer and to analyze
the elements of augury and sacrifice. Reason began
to revolt against the proposition that Jupiter was justified
in rejecting a petition because a syllable had been
omitted or a word mispronounced. Men began to ask:
"What explanation could be given of the strange
changes of mind in the gods, often threatening evil on
the first inspection of the victim, and at the second
promising good? How did it happen that a sacrifice
to Apollo gave favorable, and one to Diana unfavorable
signs? Why did the Etruscan, the Elan, the
Egyptian, and the Punic inspectors of sacrifice interpret
the entrails in an entirely different manner?
Again, what connection in nature was there between
a fissure in the liver of a lamb, and a trifling advantage
to a man, an inheritance to be expected, or the
like? And on a man's intending to sacrifice, did a
change, corresponding to his circumstances, take place
in the entrails of the beast; so that, supposing another
person had selected the same victim, he would have
found the liver in a quite different condition?"</p>

<p>The gods themselves became subjects of inspection
and analysis. Their origin and nature were studied
historically, and were also reviewed in the light of
natural and ethical products. Three hundred years
before Christ, Evhemere of Messina boldly declared
that the gods were simply ancient kings deified by
fear and superstition after death. Anaxagoras sought
to identify the several deities with the forces and phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of nature, thus converting the pantheon into
an observatory, or into a physical and chemical laboratory.
Metrodorus contended that the gods were deifications
of mere abstract ethical precepts.</p>

<p>Instances are recorded in history, from time to time,
where the philosophers attempted to explain to the
people the natural meaning of those things which they
believed were pregnant with supernatural import. On
a certain occasion, a ram with one horn was found on
the farm of Pericles, and, from this circumstance, an
Athenian diviner, named Lampon, predicted that the
party of the orator would triumph over the opposite
faction and gain control of the government. Whereupon
Anaxagoras dissected the skull, and demonstrated
to the people the natural cause of the phenomenon in
the peculiar shape of the animal's brain. But this reformer
finally suffered the fate of other innovators,
was prosecuted for impiety, and was only saved by the
influence of Pericles.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Christian era, the religion
of Rome was privately ridiculed and repudiated by
nearly all statesmen and philosophers of the empire,
although they publicly professed it on grounds of
public policy. Seneca, a contemporary of Jesus, advised
observance of rites appointed by law, on patriotic
grounds. "All which things," he says, "a wise
man will observe as being commanded by the laws, but
not as being pleasing to the gods." Again he says:
"All that ignoble rabble of gods which the superstition
of ages has heaped up, we shall adore in such a
way as to remember that their worship belongs rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
to custom than to reality." Ridiculing the popular
notions of the matrimonial relations of the deities, the
same eminent philosopher says: "And what of this,
that we unite the gods in marriage, and that not even
naturally, for we join brothers and sisters? We marry
Bellona to Mars, Venus to Vulcan, Salacia to Neptune.
Some of them we leave unmarried, as though
there were no match for them, which is surely needless,
especially when there are certain unmarried goddesses,
as Populonia, or Fulgora, or the goddess Rumina, for
whom I am not astonished that suitors have been
wanting."</p>

<p>The prevailing skepticism of the times is well illustrated
in a dialogue which Cicero introduces into his
first Tusculan Disputation between M, which may be
interpreted Marcus, and A, which may be translated
Auditor:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear"><div>
<span class="smcap">Marcus</span>: Tell me, are you not afraid of the three-headed
Cerberus in the infernal regions, and the roaring
of Cocytus, and the passage over Acheron, and
Tantalus, dying with thirst, while water laves
his chin, and Sisyphus,</div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who sweats with arduous toil in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steepy summit of the mount to gain?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div>Perhaps you are also afraid of the inexorable
judges, Minos and Rhadamanthus, because before
them neither L. Crassus nor M. Antonius
can defend you, and because appearing before
Grecian judges, you will not be permitted to
employ Demosthenes, but must plead for yourself
before a very great crowd. All these things,
perhaps, you fear, and therefore regard death as
an eternal evil.</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Auditor</span>: Do you think I'm such a fool as to give credence
to such things?</div>
<div>
<span class="smcap">Marcus</span>: What! You don't believe in them?</div>
<div>
<span class="smcap">Auditor</span>: Truly, not in the least.</div>
<div>
<span class="smcap">Marcus</span>: I am deeply pained to hear that.</div>
<div>
<span class="smcap">Auditor</span>: Why?</div>
<div>
<span class="smcap">Marcus</span>: Because, if occasion had offered, I could very
eloquently have denounced them, myself.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The contemptuous scorn of the cultivated Romans
of his time is frequently revealed in the writings of
Cicero. He refers more than once to the famous remark
of Cato, who said that he could not explain why
the haruspices did not laugh in each other's faces when
they began to sacrifice.</p>

<p>At this point, it is worthy of observation that the
prevalent unbelief was not limited to a simple denial
of the existence of mythical divinities and of the efficacy
of the worship rendered them. Roman skepticism
sought to destroy the very foundation of all religious
belief by denying not only the existence of the
gods, but also the immortality of the soul. Cicero is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>said to have been the only great Roman of his time
who believed that death was not the end. Students of
Sallust are familiar with his account of the conspiracy
of Cataline in which it is related that Julius Cæsar, in
a speech before the Roman senate, opposed putting the
traitor to death because that form of punishment was
too mild, since beyond the grave there was neither joy
nor sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Antagonism to the doctrine of the immortality of
the soul reached a melancholy refinement in the
strange contention that life after death was a cruel
thought. Pliny expresses this sentiment admirably
when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What folly it is to renew life after death. Where shall
created beings find rest if you suppose that shades in hell and
souls in heaven continue to have any feeling? You rob us
of man's greatest good&mdash;death. Let us rather find in the
tranquillity which preceded our existence the pledge of the
repose which is to follow it.</p></div>

<p>When skepticism had destroyed their faith in the
gods, and had robbed them of the consolations of religion,
educated Romans sought refuge and solace in
Greek philosophy. Stoicism and Epicureanism were
the dominant spiritual and intellectual forces of the
Roman empire at the time of Christ. Epicureanism
was founded by Epicurus, who was born of an Athenian
family in the Island of Samos about 342 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
Stoicism originated with Zeno, a native of Cittium in
Cyprus, born about the year 340 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The original design of the system of Epicurus was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>to found a commonwealth of happiness and goodness
in opposition to the purely intellectual aristocracy of
Plato and Aristotle. Men were beginning to tire of
speculation and dialectics, and to long for a philosophy
built upon human feeling and sensibility. As a touchstone
of truth, it was proposed to substitute sensation
for intellect. Whatever was pleasing to the natural
and healthful senses was to be taken to be true. The
pursuit of happiness was to be the chief aim of the
devotees of this system. The avoidance of mental pain
and physical suffering, as well as the cultivation of all
pleasurable emotions, were to be the leading features
of every Epicurean programme. In the beginning,
Epicureanism inculcated principles of virtue as a
means of happiness. The mode of life of the first
followers of Epicurus was simple and abstemious.
Barley-bread and water are said to have been their
ordinary food and drink. But in time this form of
philosophy became identified with the coarsest sensuality
and the most wicked lust. This was especially
true after it was transplanted from Greece to Italy.
The doctrines of this school met with a ready response
from the pleasure-seeking, luxury-loving Roman people
who were now enriched by the spoils and treasures
of a conquered world. "This philosophy therefore
became at Rome a mere school of self-indulgence, and
lost the refinement which, in Greece, had led it to recognize
in virtue that which gave zest to pleasure and
in temperance that which prolonged it. It called simply
for a continuous round of physical delights; it
taught the grossest sensuality; it proclaimed the inanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
of goodness and the lawfulness of lust. It was
the road&mdash;sure, steep and swift, to awful demoralization."</p>

<p>Stoicism, on the other hand, furnished spiritual and
intellectual food to that nobler class of Romans who
were at once the support and ornament of a magnificent
but decadent civilization. This form of philosophy
was peculiarly consonant with early Roman
instincts and habits. In its teachings were perfectly
reflected that vigor, austerity, and manly self-reliance
which had made the Roman race undisputed masters
of the world. Many of its precepts were not only
moral and ennobling, but deeply religious and sustaining.
A striking kinship between them and certain
Christian precepts has been frequently pointed out.
Justice, fortitude, prudence, and temperance were the
four cardinal virtues of Stoicism. Freedom from all
passions and complete simplicity of life, resulting in
perfect purity of manners, was its chief aim. But the
fundamental principles of both Epicureanism and
Stoicism were destructive of those spiritual elements
which furnish complete and permanent nourishment
to the soul. Stoicism was pantheism, and Epicureanism
was materialism. The Stoic believed that the
human soul was corporeal, but that it was animated
and illuminated by the universal soul. The Epicurean
taught that the soul was composed of material
atoms, which would perish when its component parts
separated or dissolved. Epicureanism was materialistic
in its tendency, and its inevitable result, in perverted
form, was sensualism. Stoicism was pervaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
throughout by a melancholy and desolating fatalism.
It was peculiarly the philosophy of suicide; or, as a
great French writer once described it, "an apprenticeship
for death."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> To take one's life was not only allowable
but commendable in certain cases. Zeno, the
founder of the sect, taught that incurable disease was a
sufficient excuse for suicide. Marcus Aurelius considered
it an obligation of nature and of reason to make
an end of life when it became an intolerable burden.
"Kill thyself and die erect in the consciousness of thy
own strength," would have been a suitable inscription
over the doorway of every Stoic temple. Seneca furnished
to his countrymen this Stoic panacea for all the
ills of life:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Seest thou yon steep height, that is the descent to freedom.
Seest thou yon sea, yon river, yon well; freedom sits
there in the depths. Seest thou yon low withered tree; there
freedom hangs. Seest thou thy neck, thy throat, thy heart;
they are the ways of escape from bondage.</p></div>

<p>And the Roman philosopher was not only conscientious
but consistent in his teachings. He was heroic
enough to take the medicine himself which he had prescribed
for others. Indeed, he took a double dose; for
he not only swallowed poison, but also opened his
veins, and thus committed suicide, as other Stoics&mdash;such
as Zeno, Cleanthes and Cato&mdash;had done before him.</p>

<p>It was not a problem of the Stoic philosophy,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by opposing end them?<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>A familiar illustration of the advocates of suicide
among the Roman writers was that a human body
afflicted with incurable disease, or a human mind
weighed down with intolerable grief, was like a house
filled with smoke. As it was the duty of the occupant
of the house to escape from the smoke by flight, so it
was the duty of the soul to leave the body by suicide.</p>

<p>But neither Epicureanism nor Stoicism could satisfy
the natural longing of the soul for that which is above
the earth and beyond the grave. It was impossible
that philosophy should completely displace religion.
The spiritual nature of the Roman people was still intact
and vigorous after belief in myths was dead. As
a substitute for their ancient faith and as a supplement
to philosophy, they began to deify their illustrious men
and women. The apotheosis of the emperors was the
natural result of the progressive degradation of the
Roman religion. The deification of Julius Cæsar was
the beginning of this servile form of worship; and the
apotheosis of Diocletian was the fifty-third of these
solemn canonizations. Of this number, fifteen were
those of princesses belonging to the imperial family.</p>

<p>Divine honors began to be paid to Cæsar before he
was dead. The anniversary of his birth became a national
holiday; his bust was placed in the temple, and
a month of the year was named for him. After his
assassination, he was worshiped as a god under the
name of Divus Julius; and sacrifices were offered upon
his altar. After Julius Cæsar, followed the deification
of Augustus Cæsar. Even before his death, Octavian
had consented to be worshiped in the provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
especially in Nicomedia and Pergamus. After his
death, his worship was introduced into Rome and
Italy.</p>

<p>The act of canonizing a dead emperor was accomplished
by a vote of the senate, followed by a solemn
ceremony, in which an eagle was released at the
funeral pile, and soaring upward, became a symbol of
the ascent of the deceased to the skies. A Roman senator,
Numerius Atticus, swore that he had seen Augustus
ascending to heaven at the time of his consecration;
and received from Livia a valuable gift of money as
a token of her appreciation of his kindness.</p>

<p>Not only were grand and gifted men like Julius and
Augustus Cæsar, but despicable and contemptible
tyrants like Nero and Commodus, raised to the rank
of immortals. And, not content with making gods of
emperors, the Romans made goddesses of their royal
women. Caligula had lived in incestuous intercourse
with his sister Drusilla; nevertheless, he had her immortalized
and worshiped as a divine being. This
same Caligula who was a monster of depravity, insisted
on being worshiped as a god in the flesh throughout
the Roman empire, although the custom had been
not to deify emperors until after they were dead. The
cowardly and obsequious Roman senate decreed him a
temple in Rome. The royal rascal erected another to
himself, and appointed his own private priests and
priestesses, among whom were his uncle Claudius, and
the Cæsonia who afterwards became his wife. This
temple and its ministry were maintained at an enormous
expense. Only the rarest and most costly birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
like peacocks and pheasants, were allowed to be sacrificed
to him. Such was the impious conceit of Caligula
that he requested the Asiatics of Miletus to convert
a temple of Apollo into a shrine sacred to himself.
Some of the noblest statuary of antiquity was
mutilated in displacing the heads of gods to make
places for the head of this wicked monster. A mighty
descent this, indeed, from the Olympian Zeus of Phidias
to a bust of Caligula!</p>

<p>Domitian, after his deification, had himself styled
"Lord and God," in all documents, and required all
his subjects to so address him. Pliny tells us that the
roads leading into Rome were constantly filled with
flocks and herds being driven to the Capital to be sacrificed
upon his altar.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The natural and inevitable result of the decay of the
Roman religion was the corruption and demoralization
of Roman social life. All experience teaches that
an assault upon a people's religious system is an assault
upon the entire social and moral organization. Every
student of history knows that a nation will be prosperous
and happy to the extent that it is religiously
intelligent, and in proportion to its loyalty to the laws
of social virtue, to the laws of good government, and
the laws of God; and that an abandonment of its gods
means the wreck and dissolution of its entire social
structure. The annals of Rome furnish a striking confirmation
of this fact.</p>

<p>The closing pages of this chapter will be devoted to
a short topical review of Roman society at the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>Christ. Only a few phases of the subject can be presented
in a work of this character.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">GRÆCO-ROMAN SOCIAL LIFE</span></h4>

<p><i>Marriage and Divorce.</i>&mdash;The family is the unit of
the social system; and at the hearthstone all civilization
begins. The loosening of the domestic ties is the
beginning of the dissolution of the state; and whatever
weakens the nuptial bonds, tends to destroy the moral
fiber of society. The degradation of women and the
destruction of domestic purity were the first signs of
decay in Roman life. In the early ages of the republic,
marriage was regarded not only as a contract, but as a
sacrament as well. Connubial fidelity was sacredly
maintained. Matrons of the type of Cornelia, the
mother of the Gracchi, were objects of national pride
and affection. The spirit of desperation which caused
the father of Virginia to plunge a butcher's knife into
the chaste and innocent heart of his child to save her
from the lust of Appius Claudius, was a tragic illustration
of the almost universal Roman respect for
virtue in the age of the Tarquins. To such an extent
were the marital relations venerated by the early
Romans that we are assured by Dionysius that five
hundred and twenty years had passed before a single
divorce was granted. Carvilius Ruga, the name of the
first Roman to procure a divorce, has been handed
down to us.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>If we are to believe Döllinger, the abandonment of
the policy of lifelong devotion to the marriage relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>and the inauguration of the system of divorce were
due not to the faults of the men but to the dangerous
and licentious qualities of the Roman women. In connection
with the divorce of Carvilius Ruga, he discusses
a widespread conspiracy of Roman wives to
poison their husbands. Several of these husbands fell
victims to this plot; and, as punishment for the crime,
twenty married women were forced to take the poison
which they had themselves prepared, and were thus
put to death. And, about a half century after this
divorce, several wives of distinguished Romans were
discovered to be participants in the bacchanalian
orgies. From all these things, Döllinger infers that
the Roman men began to tire of their wives and to seek
legal separation from them.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>But, whatever the cause, the marriage tie was so
easily severed during the latter years of the republic,
that divorce was granted on the slightest pretext. Q.
Antistius Vetus divorced his wife because she was talking
familiarly and confidentially to one of his freedmen.
The wife of C. Sulpicius imprudently entered
the street without a veil, and her husband secured a
divorce on that ground. P. Sempronius Sophus put
away his wife for going to the theater without his
knowledge.</p>

<p>Cicero divorced his first wife that he might marry
a younger and wealthier woman; and because this second
one did not exhibit sufficient sorrow at the death
of his daughter, Tullia, he repudiated her.</p>

<p>Cato, the stern Stoic moralist, was several times divorced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>To accommodate his friend Hortensius he
gave him his second wife Marcia, with her father's
consent; and, after the death of the orator, he remarried
her.</p>

<p>After being several times previously divorced, Pompey
put away Mucia in order that he might wed Julia,
Cæsar's daughter, who was young enough to be the
child of Pompey.</p>

<p>Cæsar himself was five times married. He divorced
his wife, Pompeia, because of her relationship to Clodius,
a dashing and dissolute young Roman, who
entered Cæsar's house on the occasion of the celebration
of the feast of the Bona Dea in a woman's dress,
in order that he might pay clandestine suit to the object
of his lust. Cæsar professed to believe that the charges
against Pompeia were not true, but he divorced her
nevertheless, with the remark that "Cæsar's wife must
be above suspicion." We are reminded by this that,
in ancient as in modern times, society placed greater
restrictions upon women than upon men; for Cæsar,
who uttered this virtuous and heroic sentiment, was a
most notorious rake and profligate. Suetonius tells us
that he debauched many Roman ladies of the first
rank; among them "Lollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius;
Tertulla, the wife of Marcus Crassus; and
Mucia, the wife of Cneius Pompey." It was frequently
made a reproach to Pompey, "that to gratify
his ambition, he married the daughter of a man upon
whose account he had divorced his wife, after having
had three children by her; and whom he used, with a
deep sigh, to call Ægisthus." But the favorite mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
of Cæsar was Servilia, the mother of Marcus Brutus.
To consummate an intrigue with her, he gave Servilia
a pearl which cost him six millions of sesterces. And
at the time of the civil war he had deeded to her
for a trifling consideration, several valuable farms.
When people expressed surprise at the lowness of the
price, Cicero humorously remarked: "To let you
know the real value of the purchase, between ourselves,
Tertia was deducted." It was generally suspected at
Rome that Servilia had prostituted her daughter Tertia
to Cæsar; and the witticism of the orator was a
<i>double entendre</i>, Tertia signifying the third (of the
value of the farm), as well as being the name of the
girl, whose virtue had paid the price of the deduction.
Cæsar's lewdness was so flagrant and notorious that his
soldiers marching behind his chariot, on the occasion
of his Gallic triumph, shouted in ribald jest, to the
multitude along the way:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Watch well your wives, ye cits, we bring a blade,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>If this was the private life of the greatest Roman of
the world, who, at the time of his death, was Pontifex
Maximus, the supreme head of the Roman religion,
what must have been the social life of the average citizen
who delighted to style Cæsar the demigod while
living and to worship him as divine, when dead?</p>

<p>A thorough knowledge of the details of the most
corrupt and abandoned state of society recorded in
history may be had by a perusal of the Annals of Tacitus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>and the Satires of Juvenal. The Sixth Satire is a
withering arraignment of Roman profligacy and wickedness.
"To see the world in its worst estate," says
Professor Jowett, "we turn to the age of the satirists
and of Tacitus, when all the different streams of evil,
coming from east, west, north, south, the vices of barbarism
and the vices of civilization, remnants of ancient
cults, and the latest refinements of luxury and
impurity, met and mingled on the banks of the Tiber."
Rome was the heart of the empire that pumped its
filthy blood from the center to the extremities, and received
from the provinces a return current of immorality
and corruption. Juvenal complains that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long since the stream that wanton Syria laves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has disembogued its filth in Tiber's waves.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Grecian literature and manners were the main cause
of Roman dissoluteness.</p>

<p>The grandfather of Cicero is said to have made this
declaration: "A Roman's wickedness increases in proportion
to his acquaintance with Greek authors." It
is undeniably true that the domestic immorality of the
Greeks exercised a most baneful influence upon the
social life of the Romans. Both at Athens and in
Sparta marriage was regarded as the means to an end,
the procreation of children as worshipers of the gods
and citizens of the state. In this fundamental purpose
were involved, the Greeks believed, the mission and
the destiny of woman. Marriage was not so much a
sacred institution, as it was a convenient arrangement
whereby property rights were regulated and soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>were provided for the army and the navy. This view
was entertained by both the Athenians and the Spartans.
The code of Lycurgus regulated the family relations
to the end that healthy, vigorous children might
be born to a military commonwealth. The Spartan
maidens were required to exercise in the palestra,
almost naked, in the presence of men and strangers.
And so loose and extravagant were the ideas of conjugal
fidelity among the Spartans that it was not regarded
as an improper thing to borrow another man's
wife for the purpose of procreating children, if there
had already been born to the legitimate husband all
the children that he desired. This we learn from
Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and from Polybius,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> who assure us that it
often happened that as many as four Spartans had one
woman, in common, for a wife. "Already in the time
of Socrates, the wives of Sparta had reached the height
of disrepute for their wantonness throughout the whole
of Greece; Aristotle says that they lived in unbridled
licentiousness; and, indeed, it is a distinctive feature
in the female character there, that publicly and shamelessly
they would speed a well-known seducer of a
woman of rank by wishing him success, and charging
him to think only of endowing Sparta with brave
boys."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

</div>
<hr class="l1" />
<p>At Athens the principle was the same, even if the
gratification of lust was surrounded with a halo of
poetry and sentiment which the Spartan imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>was incapable of creating. The Athenians were guilty
of a strange perversion of the social instincts by placing
a higher appreciation upon the charms of a certain
class of lewd women that they did upon the virtuous
merits of their own wives and mothers. These latter
were kept in retirement and denied the highest educational
advantages; while the former, the Hetairai,
beautiful and brilliant courtesans, destined for the
pleasure and entertainment of illustrious men, were
accorded the utmost freedom, as well as all the advantages
of culture in the arts and sciences. Demosthenes
has classified the women of ancient Athens in this sentence:
"We have Hetairai for our pleasure, concubines
for the ordinary requirements of the body, and
wives for the procreation of lawful issue and as confidential
domestic guardians." The most renowned of
the Hetairai was Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles.
She was exceedingly beautiful and brilliantly accomplished.
At her house in Athens, poets, philosophers,
statesmen, and sculptors frequently gathered to do her
honor. Pericles is said to have wept only three times
in life; and one of these was when he defended Aspasia
before the dicastery of Athens against the charge of
impiety.</p>

<p>Another of the Hetairai scarcely less famous than
Aspasia was the celebrated Athenian courtesan,
Phryne. Praxiteles, the sculptor, was one of her adorers.
She, too, was tried for impiety before the dicastery.
Hiperides, the Attic orator, defended her. To
create a favorable impression upon the court, he bade
her reveal her bosom to the judges. She did so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
was acquitted. So great was the veneration in which
Phryne was held that it was considered no profanation
to place her image in the sacred temple at Delphi.
And so overwhelming was her beauty, that her statues
were identified with the Aphrodite of Apelles and the
Cnidian goddess of Praxiteles. At Eleusis, on the
occasion of a national festival, she impersonated Venus
by entering naked into the waves, in the presence of
spectators from all the cities of Greece. She is said
to have amassed such a fortune that she felt justified
in offering to build the walls of Thebes.</p>

<p>Such was the esteem in which these elegant harlots
were held, that we find recorded among their patrons
on the pages of Greek history the names of Pericles,
Demades, Lysias, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Aristotle,
Aristippus, and Epicurus. So little odium attached to
the occupation of this class of women that we read that
Socrates frequently paid visits to one of them named
Theodota and advised her as to the best method of
gaining "friends" and keeping them.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>As the sculptors did not hesitate to carve the images
of the Hetairai in marble and give them the names of
the goddesses of Olympus, so the poets, orators, and
historians did not fail to immortalize them in their
poems, orations, and annals. Greek statuary and literature
were then transported to Italy to corrupt
Roman manners. It was not long before adultery and
seduction had completely poisoned and polluted every
fountain of Roman private life. "Liaisons in the first
houses," says Mommsen, "had become so frequent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>that only a scandal altogether exceptional could make
them the subject of special talk; a judicial interference
seems now almost ridiculous."</p>

<p>Roman women of patrician rank, not content with
noblemen as lovers, sought out "lewd fellows of the
baser sort" among slaves and gladiators, as companions
of corrupt intrigues. Juvenal, in his Sixth Satire,
paints a horrible picture of social depravity when he
describes the lewdness of Messalina, the wife of Claudius
I. This woman, the wife of an emperor, and the
mother of the princely Britannicus, descends from the
imperial bed, in the company of a single female slave,
at the dead of night, to a common Roman brothel,
assumes the name Lycisca, and submits to the embraces
of the coarsest Roman debauchees.</p>

<p>The degradation of women was not peculiar to the
Capital of the empire, but extended to every province.
Social impurity was rankest in the East, but it was
present everywhere. Virtue seemed to have left the
earth, and Vice had taken her place as the supreme
mistress of the world.</p>

<p><i>Luxury and Extravagance.</i>&mdash;At the birth of Christ,
the frontiers of the Roman empire comprised all the
territory of the then civilized world. In extending her
conquests, Rome laid heavy tribute upon conquered
nations. All the wealth of the earth flowed into her
coffers. The result was unexampled luxury and extravagance.
A single illustration will serve to show
the mode of life of the wealthy Roman citizen of the
time of which we write. Lucullus, the lieutenant of
Sulla, and the friend of Cicero and Pompey, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
amassed enormous wealth in the Mithradatic wars.
This fortune he employed to inaugurate and maintain
a style of social life whose splendor and extravagance
were the astonishment and scandal of his age and race.
The meals served upon his table, even when no guests
were present, were marked by all the taste, elegance,
and completeness of a banquet. On one occasion, when
he happened to dine alone, the table was not arranged
with the ordinary fullness and splendor; whereupon
he made complaint to the servants, who replied that
they did not think it necessary to prepare so completely
when he was alone. "What! did you not know that
Lucullus would dine with Lucullus?" was his answer.
At another time, Cicero and Pompey met him in the
Forum and requested that he take them with him to
dine, as they desired to learn how his table was spread
when no visitors were expected. Lucullus was embarrassed
for a moment; but soon regained his composure,
and replied that he would be delighted to have such
distinguished Romans dine with him, but that he
would like to have a day for preparation. They refused
this request, however; nor would they consent
that he send directions to his servants, as they
desired to see how meals were served in his home
when no guests were there. Lucullus then requested
Cicero and Pompey to permit him to tell his servants,
in their presence, in what room the repast should
be served. They consented to this; and Lucullus
then directed that the Hall of Apollo should be arranged
for the dinner. Now the dining rooms in
the home of Lucullus were graded in price; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
only necessary to designate the room in order to notify
the servants of the style and costliness of the entertainment
desired. The Hall of Apollo called for an expenditure,
at each meal, of fifty thousand drachmas,
the equivalent of $10,000 in our money. And when
Cicero and Pompey sat down at the table of Lucullus
a few hours later, the decorations of the room and the
feast spread before them, offered a spectacle of indescribable
beauty and luxury. The epicure had outwitted
the orator and the general.</p>

<p>Other anecdotes related by Plutarch also illustrate
the luxurious life of Lucullus. Once when Pompey
was sick, his physician prescribed a thrush for his
meal; whereupon Pompey's servants notified him that
a thrush could not be secured in Italy during the
summer time, except in the fattening coops of Lucullus.</p>

<p>Cato despised the luxurious habits of Lucullus; and,
on one occasion, when a young man was extolling the
beauties of frugality and temperance in a speech before
the senate, the Stoic interrupted him by asking: "How
long do you mean to go on making money like Crassus,
living like Lucullus and talking like Cato?"<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Lucullus was not the only Roman of his day who
spent fabulous sums of money in luxurious living and
in building palatial residences. M. Lepidus, who was
elected Consul in 87 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, erected the most magnificent
private edifice ever seen in Rome.</p>

<p>But the culmination of magnificence in Roman
architecture was the Golden House of Nero. Its walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>were covered with gold and studded with precious
stones. The banquet rooms were decorated with gorgeous
ceilings, and were so constructed that from them
flowers and perfumes could be showered from above
on the guests below.</p>

<p>Concerning the luxurious life of the later days of the
republic, Mommsen says: "Extravagant prices, as
much as one hundred thousand sesterces (£1,000)
were paid for an exquisite cook. Houses were constructed
with special reference to this subject.... A
dinner was already described as poor at which the
fowls were served up to the guests entire, and not
merely the choice portions.... At banquets, above
all, the Romans displayed their hosts of slaves ministering
to luxury, their bands of musicians, their
dancing-girls, their elegant furniture, their carpets
glittering with gold, or pictorially embroidered, their
rich silver plate."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>But the luxury and extravagance of the Romans
were nowhere so manifest as in their public bathing
establishments. "The magnificence of many of the
thermæ and their luxurious arrangements were such
that some writers, as Seneca, are quite lost in their descriptions
of them. The piscinæ were often of immense
size&mdash;that of Diocletian being 200 feet long&mdash;and
were adorned with beautiful marbles. The halls
were crowded with magnificent columns, and were
ornamented with the finest pieces of statuary. The
walls, it has been said, were covered with exquisite
mosaics that imitated the art of the painter in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>elegance of design and variety of color. The Egyptian
syenite was encrusted with the precious green
marbles of Numidia. The rooms contained the works
of Phidias and Praxiteles. A perpetual stream of
water was poured into capacious basins through the
wide mouths of lions of bright and polished silver.
'To such a pitch of luxury have we reached,' says
Seneca, 'that we are dissatisfied if we do not tread on
gems in our baths.'"<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The circuses were scarcely inferior to the baths in
magnificence. Caligula is said to have strewn them
with gold dust.</p>

<p>The result of Roman luxury in the matter of food
and drink was a coarse and loathsome gluttony which
finds no parallel in modern life. Epicureanism had
degenerated from barley-bread and water to the costliest
diet ever known. Wealthy Romans of the age of
Augustus did not hesitate to pay two hundred and fifty
dollars for a single fish&mdash;the mullet. And that they
might indulge their appetite to the fullest extent, and
prolong the pleasures of eating beyond the requirements
and even the capacity of nature, they were in
the habit of taking an emetic at meal times. We learn
from the letters of Cicero that Julius Cæsar did this on
one occasion when he went to visit the orator at his
country villa. And the degeneracy of Roman life is
nowhere more clearly indicated than in the Fourth
Satire of Juvenal where he describes the gathering of
the great men of the state, at the call of Domitian, to
determine how a turbot should be cooked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>
<p>But the reader must not infer that all Romans were
rich and that luxury was indulged in every home. In
the Roman capital the extremes of wealth and poverty
met. The city was filled with idlers, vagabonds and
paupers from all quarters of the globe. In the early
days of the Republic, sturdy farmers had tilled the
soil of Italy and had filled the legions with brave and
hardy warriors. The beginning of the empire witnessed
a radical change. Hundreds of thousands of
these farmers had been driven from their lands to
furnish homes to the disbanded soldiers of conquerors
like Sulla, Marius, and Cæsar. Homeless and poverty-stricken,
they wandered away to Rome to swell
the ranks of mendicants and adventurers that crowded
the streets of the imperial city. The soldiers themselves,
finding agriculture distasteful and unprofitable,
sold their lands to Roman speculators, and returned to
the scene of the triumphs of their military masters.
The inevitable consequence of this influx of strangers
and foreigners, without wealth and without employment,
was the degradation and demoralization of
Roman social and industrial life. Augustus was compelled
to make annual donations of money and provisions
to 200,000 persons who wandered helpless
about the streets. This state of things&mdash;fabulous
wealth in the hands of a few, and abject poverty as the
lot of millions&mdash;was the harbinger sure and swift of
the destruction of the state.</p>

<p><i>Slavery.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of the Christian era,
slavery existed in every province of the Roman empire.
Nearly everywhere the number of slaves was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
much greater than that of the free citizens. In
Attica, according to the census of Demetrius Phalereus,
about the beginning of the fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
there were 400,000 slaves, 10,000 foreign settlers, and
20,000 free citizens. Zumpt estimates that there were
two slaves to every freeman in Rome in the year 5 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
It frequently happened that a wealthy Roman possessed
as many as 20,000 slaves. Slaves who gained
their freedom might themselves become masters and
own slaves. During the reign of Augustus, a freedman
died, leaving 4,116 slaves. Crassus possessed so
many that his company of architects and carpenters
alone exceeded 500 in number.</p>

<p>The principal slave markets of Greece were those at
Athens, Ephesus, Cyprus, and Samos. In the market
place of each of these cities, slaves were exposed for
sale upon wooden scaffolds. From the neck of each
was hung a tablet or placard containing a description
of his or her meritorious qualities, such as parentage,
educational advantages, health and freedom from
physical defects. They were required to strip themselves
at the request of purchasers. In this way, the
qualifications of slaves for certain purposes could be
accurately judged. The vigorous, large-limbed Cappadocians,
for instance, like our modern draft horses,
were selected for their strength and their ability to lift
heavy loads and endure long-continued work.</p>

<p>The property of the master in the slave was absolute.
The owner might kill or torture his slave at will.
Neither the government nor any individual could
bring him to account for it. Roman law compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
female slaves to surrender themselves, against their
will, to their master's lust. All the coarseness and brutality
of the haughty, arrogant, and merciless Roman
disposition were manifested in the treatment of their
slaves. Nowhere do we find any mercy or humanity
shown them. On the farms they worked with chains
about their limbs during the day; and at night they
were lodged in the <i>ergastula</i>&mdash;subterranean apartments,
badly lighted and poorly ventilated. The most
cruel punishment awaited the slave who attempted to
escape. The <i>fugitavarii</i>&mdash;professional slave chasers&mdash;ran
him down, branded him on the forehead, and
brought him back to his master. If the master was
very rich, or cared little for the life of the slave, he
usually commanded him to be thrown, as a punishment
for his attempt to flee, to the wild beasts in the amphitheater.
This cruel treatment was not exceptional, but
was ordinary. Cato, the paragon among the Stoics,
was so merciless in his dealings with his slaves that one
of them committed suicide rather than await the hour
of punishment for some transgression of which he was
guilty.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> It frequently happened that the slaves had
knowledge of crimes committed by their masters. In
such cases they were fortunate if they escaped death,
as the probability of their becoming witnesses against
their masters offered every inducement to put them out
of the way. In his defense of Cluentius, Cicero speaks
of a slave who had his tongue cut out to prevent his
betraying his mistress.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> If a slave murdered his master,
all his fellow-slaves under the same roof were held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>responsible for the deed. Thus four hundred slaves
were put to death for the act of one who assassinated
Pedanius Secundus, during the reign of Nero.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Augustus
had his steward, Eros, crucified on the mast of
his ship because the slave had roasted and eaten a quail
that had been trained for the royal quail-pit. Once a
slave was flung to the fishes because he had broken a
crystal goblet.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> On another occasion, a slave was compelled
to march around a banquet table, in the presence
of the guests, with his hands, which had been cut
off, hanging from his neck, because he had stolen some
trifling article of silverware. Cicero, in his prosecution
of Verres, recites an instance of mean and cowardly
cruelty toward a slave. "At the time," he says,
"in which L. Domitius was prætor in Sicily, a slave
killed a wild boar of extraordinary size. The prætor,
struck by the dexterity and courage of the man, desired
to see him. The poor wretch, highly gratified
with the distinction, came to present himself before
the prætor, in hopes, no doubt, of praise and reward;
but Domitius, on learning that he had only a javelin
to attack and kill the boar, ordered him to be instantly
crucified, under the barbarous pretext that the law
prohibited the use of this weapon, as of all others, to
slaves."</p>

<p>The natural consequence of this cruel treatment was
unbounded hatred of the master by the slave. "We
have as many enemies," says Seneca, "as we have
slaves." And what rendered the situation perilous was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>the numerical superiority of the slave over the free
population. "They multiply at an immense rate,"
says Tacitus, "whilst freemen diminish in equal proportion."
Pliny the Younger gave expression to the
universal apprehension when he wrote: "By what
dangers we are beset! No one is safe; not even the
most indulgent, gentlest master." Precautionary measures
were adopted from time to time both by individuals
and by the government to prevent concerted
action among the slaves and to conceal from them all
evidences of their own strength. To keep down mutiny
among his slaves, Cato is said to have constantly
excited dissension and enmity among them. "It was
once proposed," says Gibbon, "to discriminate the
slaves by a peculiar habit; but it was justly apprehended
that there might be some danger in acquainting
them with their own numbers."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>If the Roman masters maltreated and destroyed the
bodies of their slaves, the slaves retaliated by corrupting
and destroying the morals of their masters. The
institution of slavery was one of the most potent agencies
in the demoralization of ancient Roman manners.
The education of children was generally confided to
the slaves, who did not fail to poison their minds and
hearts in many ways. In debauching their female
slaves, the Roman masters polluted their own morals
and corrupted their own manhood. The result teaches
us that the law of physics is the law of morals: that
action and reaction are equal, but in opposite directions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
<i>Destruction of New-Born Infants.</i>&mdash;The destruction
of new-born children was the deepest stain upon the
civilization of the ancient Greeks and Romans. In
obedience to a provision of the code of Lycurgus, every
Spartan child was exhibited immediately after birth
to public view; and, if it was found to be deformed
and weakly, so that it was unfit to grow into a strong
and healthy citizen of the Spartan military commonwealth,
it was exposed to perish on Mount Taygetus.
The practice of exposing infants was even more arbitrary
and cruel in Rome than in Greece. The Roman
father was bound by no limitations; but could cast his
offspring away to die, through pure caprice. Paulus,
the celebrated jurist of the imperial period, admitted
that this was a paternal privilege. Suetonius tells us
that the day of the death of Germanicus, which took
place A.D. 19, was signalized by the exposition of children
who were born on that day.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> This was done as a
manifestation of general sorrow. The emperor Augustus
banished his granddaughter Julia on account of
her lewdness and licentiousness, as he had done in the
case of his daughter, Julia. In exile, she gave birth to
a child which Augustus caused to be exposed. It often
happened that new-born babes that had been cast away
to die of cold and hunger or to be devoured by dogs
or wild beasts were rescued by miscreants who brought
them up to devote them to evil purposes. The male
children were destined to become gladiators, and the
females were sold to houses of prostitution. Often
such children were picked up by those who disfigured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>and deformed them for the purpose of associating
them with themselves as beggars.</p>

<p>The custom of exposing infants was born of the
spirit of fierceness and barbarity that characterized
many ancient races. Its direct tendency was to make
savages of men by destroying those tender and humane
feelings for the weak and helpless which have been the
most marked attributes of modern civilizations. Occasionally
in our day one hears or reads of a proposition
by some pseudo-philanthropist that the good of
the race demands the destruction of certain persons&mdash;deformed
infants, imbecile adults and the like. But
the humanity of the age invariably frowns upon such
proposals. The benign and merciful features of our
Christian creed would be outraged by such a practice.</p>

<p><i>Gladiatorial Games.</i>&mdash;The combats of gladiators
were the culmination of Roman barbarity and brutality.
All the devotees of vice and crime met and mingled
at the arena, and derived strength and inspiration
from its bloody scenes. The gatherings in the amphitheater
were miniatures of Roman life. There,
political matters were discussed and questions of state
determined, as was once the case in the public assemblies
of the people. Now that the gates of Janus were
closed for the third time in Roman history, the combats
of the arena took the place, on a diminutive scale,
of those battles by which Romans had conquered the
world. The processions of the gladiators reminded the
enthusiastic populace of the triumphal entries of their
conquerors into the Roman capital. Nothing so
glutted the appetite and quenched the thirst of a cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and licentious race as the gorgeous ceremonials and
bloody butchery of the gladiatorial shows.</p>

<p>These contests, strange to say, first took place at
funerals, and were intended to honor the dead. In 264
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, at the burial of D. Junius Brutus, we are told,
three pairs of gladiators fought in the cattle market.
Again, in 216 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, at the obsequies of M. Æmilius
Lepidus, twenty-two pairs engaged in combat in the
Forum. And, in 174 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, on the death of his father,
Titus Flaminius caused seventy-four pairs to fight for
three days.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It will thus be seen that the death of one
Roman generally called for that of several others.</p>

<p>In time, the fondness of these contests had grown so
great that generals and statesmen arranged them on a
gigantic scale as a means of winning the favor and support
of the multitude. The Roman proletariat demanded
not only bread to satisfy their hunger, but
games to amuse them in their hours of idleness. Augustus
not only gave money and rations to 200,000
idlers, but inaugurated gladiatorial shows in which
10,000 combatants fought. Not only men but wild
beasts were brought into the arena. Pompey arranged
a fight of 500 lions, 18 elephants and 410 other ferocious
animals, brought from Africa. In a chase arranged
by Augustus, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 5, 36 crocodiles were killed
in the Flaminian circus, which was flooded for
the purpose. Caligula brought 400 bears into the
arena to fight with an equal number of African wild
animals. But all previous shows were surpassed in
the magnificent games instituted by Trajan, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 106,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>to celebrate his victories on the Danube. These games
lasted four months; and, in them, 10,000 gladiators
fought, and 11,000 beasts were slain.</p>

<p>Such was the thirst for blood, and to such a pitch
had the fury of the passions reached at the beginning
of the empire that Romans were no longer satisfied
with small fights by single pairs. They began to demand
regular battles and a larger flow of blood. And
to please the populace, Julius Cæsar celebrated his
triumph by a real battle in the circus. On each side
were arrayed 500 foot soldiers, 300 cavalrymen, and 20
elephants bearing soldiers in towers upon their backs.
This was no mimic fray, but an actual battle in which
blood was shed and men were killed. To vary the entertainment,
Cæsar also arranged a sea fight. He
caused a lake to be dug out on Mars Field, and placed
battleships upon it which represented Tyrian and
Egyptian fleets. These he caused to be manned by a
thousand soldiers and 2,000 oarsmen. A bloody fight
then ensued between men who had no other motive
in killing each other than to furnish a Roman holiday.
Augustus also arranged a sea fight upon an
artificial lake where 3,000 men were engaged. But
both these battles were eclipsed by the great sea
fight which the emperor Claudius caused to be
fought on Lake Fucinus, in the presence of a great
multitude that lined the shore. Nineteen thousand
men engaged in the bloody struggle. On an eminence
overlooking the lake, the Empress Agrippina, in gorgeous
costume, sat by the side of the emperor and
watched the battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>Announcement of gladiatorial fights in the amphitheater
was made by posters on the walls of the city.
In these advertisements, the number and names of the
fighters were announced. On the day of the performance
a solemn procession of gladiators, walking in
couples, passed through the streets to the arena. The
arrangements of the building and the manner of the
fights were so ordered as to arouse to the highest pitch
of excitement the passions and expectations of the
spectators. The citizens were required to wear the
white toga. The lower rows of seats were occupied by
senators, in whose midst were the boxes occupied by
the imperial family. The equestrian order occupied
places immediately above the senators. The citizens
were seated next after the equestrians, and in the top-most
rows, on benches, were gathered the Roman rabble.
An immense party-colored awning, stretched
above the multitude, reflected into the arena its variegated
hues. Strains of music filled the air while
preparations for the combat were being made. The
atmosphere of the amphitheater was kept cool and
fragrant by frequent sprays of perfume. The regular
combat was preceded by a mock fight with blunt
weapons. Then followed arrangements for the life-and-death
struggle. The manager of the games finally
gave the command, and the fight was on. When one
of the gladiators was wounded, the words "hoc habet"
were shouted. The wounded man fell to the earth,
dropped his weapon, and, holding up his forefinger,
begged his life from the people. If mercy was refused
him, he was compelled to renew the combat or to submit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
to the death stroke of his antagonist. Attendants
were at hand with hot irons to apply to the victim to
see that death was not simulated. If life was not extinct,
the fallen gladiator was dragged out to the dead
room, and there dispatched. Servants then ran into
the arena and scattered sand over the blood-drenched
ground. Other fighters standing in readiness, immediately
rushed in to renew the contest. Thus the fight
went on until the Roman populace was glutted with
butchery and blood.</p>

<p>Gladiators were chosen from the strongest and most
athletic among slaves and condemned criminals. Thracians,
Gauls, and Germans were captured and enslaved
for the purpose of being sacrificed in the arena. They
were trained with the greatest care in gladiatorial
schools. The most famous of these institutions was at
Capua in Italy. It was here that Spartacus, a young
Thracian, of noble ancestry, excited an insurrection
that soon spread throughout all Italy and threatened
the destruction of Rome. Addressing himself to seventy
of his fellow-gladiators, Spartacus is said to have
made a bitter and impassioned speech in which he proposed
that, if they must die, they should die fighting
their enemies and not themselves; that, if they were to
engage in bloody battles, these battles should be fought
under the open sky in behalf of life and liberty, and
not in the amphitheater to furnish pastime and entertainment
to their masters and oppressors. The speech
had its effect. The band of fighters broke out of
Capua, and took refuge in the crater of Mount Vesuvius
(73 <span class="small">B.C.</span>). Spartacus became the leader, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Crixus and &#339;nomaus, two Celtic gladiators, as lieutenants.
Their ranks soon swelled to the proportions
of an army, through accessions of slaves and desperadoes
from the neighborhood of the volcano. During
two years, they terrorized all Italy, defeated two consuls,
and burned many cities. Crixus was defeated and
killed at Mount Gargarus in Apulia by the prætor
Arrius. Spartacus compelled three hundred Roman
prisoners, whom he had captured, to fight as gladiators,
following Roman custom, at the grave of his
fallen comrade and lieutenant. Finally, he himself
was slain, sword in hand, having killed two centurions
before he fell. With the death of their leaders, the
insurgents either surrendered or fled. Those who were
captured were crucified. It is said that the entire way
from Capua to Rome was marked by crosses on which
their bodies were suspended, to the number of ten
thousand.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Throughout Italy were amphitheaters for gladiatorial
games. But the largest and most celebrated of all
was the Coliseum at Rome. Its ruins are still standing.
It was originally called the Flavian Amphitheater.
This vast building was begun <span class="small">A.D.</span> 72, upon the
site of the reservoir of Nero, by the emperor Vespasian,
who built as far as the third row of arches, the
last two rows being finished by Titus after his return
from the conquest of Jerusalem. It is said that twelve
thousand captive Jews were employed in this work, as
the Hebrews were employed in building the Pyramids
of Egypt, and that the external walls alone cost nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>four millions of dollars. It consists of four stories: the
first, Doric; the second, Ionic; the third and fourth,
Corinthian. Its circumference is nearly two thousand
feet; its length, six hundred and twenty feet; and
its width, five hundred and thirteen. The entrance for
the emperor was between two arches facing the Esquiline,
where there was no cornice. The arena was surrounded
by a wall sufficiently high to protect the spectators
from the wild beasts, which were introduced by
subterranean passages, closed by huge gates from the
side. The Amphitheater is said to have been capable
of seating eighty-seven thousand people, and was inaugurated
by gladiatorial games that lasted one hundred
days, and in which five thousand beasts were
slain. The emperor Commodus himself fought in the
Coliseum, and killed both gladiators and wild beasts.
He insisted on calling himself Hercules, was dressed in
a lion's skin, and had his hair sprinkled with gold dust.</p>

</div>
<hr class="l1" />
<p>An oriental monk, Talemachus, was so horrified at
the sight of the gladiatorial games, that he rushed into
the midst of the arena, and besought the spectators to
have them stopped. Instead of listening to him, they
put him to death.</p>

<p>The first martyrdom in the Coliseum was that of St.
Ignatius, said to have been the child especially blessed
by our Savior, the disciple of John, and the companion
of Polycarp, who was sent to Rome from Antioch
when he was bishop. When brought into the arena,
St. Ignatius knelt down and exclaimed: "Romans who
are here present, know that I have not been brought
into this place for any crime, but in order that by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
means I may merit the fruition of the glory of God,
for love of whom I have been made a prisoner. I am
as the grain of the field and must be ground by the
teeth of the lions that I may become bread fit for His
table." The lions were then let loose, and devoured
him, except the larger bones which the Christians collected
during the night.</p>

<p>The spot where the Christian martyrs suffered was
for a long time marked by a tall cross devoutly kissed
by the faithful. The Pulpit of the Coliseum was used
for the stormy sermons of Gavazzi, who called the
people to arms from thence in the Revolution of
March, 1848.</p>

<p><i>Græco-Roman Social Depravity, Born of Religion
and Traceable to the Gods.</i>&mdash;The modern mind identifies
true religion with perfect purity of heart and
with boundless love. "Do unto others as you would
have others do unto you" is the leading aphorism of
both the Hebrew and Christian faiths. The Sermon
on the Mount is the chart of the soul on the sea of life;
and its beatitudes are the glorifications of the virtues
of meekness, mercy, and peace. To the mind imbued
with the divine precepts of the Savior, it seems incredible
that religion should have ever been the direct
source of crime and sin. It is, nevertheless, a well-established
fact that the Roman and Greek mythologies
were the potent causes of political corruption and
social impurity in both Italy and Greece. Nothing
better illustrates this truth than the abominable practice
that found its inspiration and excuse in the myth
of the rape of Ganymede. The guilty passion of Zeus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
for the beautiful boy whom he, himself, in the form of
an eagle, had snatched up from earth and carried away
to Olympus to devote to shameful and unnatural uses,
was the foundation, in Greece, of the most loathsome
habit that ever disgraced the conduct of men. Passionate
fondness for beautiful boys, called paiderastia in
Greek, termed sodomy in modern criminal law, was
the curse and infamy of both Roman and Grecian life.
This unnatural vice was not confined to the vulgar and
degenerate. Men of letters, poets, statesmen and philosophers,
debased themselves with this form of pollution.
It was even legalized by the laws of Crete and
Sparta. Polybius tells us that many Romans paid as
much as a talent ($1,000) for a beautifully formed
youth. This strange perversion of the sexual instincts
was marked by all the tenderness and sweetness of a
modern courtship or a honeymoon. The victim of this
degrading and disgusting passion treated the beautiful
boy with all the delicacy and feeling generally paid a
newly wedded wife. Kisses and caresses were at times
showered upon him. At other times, he became an
object of insane jealousy.</p>

<p>An obscene couplet in Suetonius attributes this filthy
habit to Julius Cæsar in the matter of an abominable
relationship with the King of Bithynia.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> "So strong
was the influence of the prevalent epidemic on Plato,
that he had lost all sense of the love of women, and in
his descriptions of Eros, divine as well as human, his
thoughts were centered only in his boy passion. The
result in Greece confessedly was that the inclination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>for a woman was looked upon as low and dishonorable,
while that for a youth was the only one worthy of a
man of education."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>A moment's reflection will convince the most skeptical
of the progress of morality and the advance of
civilization. That which philosophers and emperors
not only approved but practiced in the palmiest days
of the commonwealths of Greece and Rome, is to-day
penalized; and the person guilty of the offense is socially
ostracized and branded with infamy and contempt.</p>

<p>The above is only one of many illustrations of the
demoralizing influence of the myths. The Greeks
looked to the gods as models of behavior, and could
see nothing wrong in paiderastia, since both Zeus and
Apollo had practiced it. Nearly every crime committed
by the Greeks and Romans was sought to be
excused on the ground that the gods had done the same
thing. Euthyphro justified mistreatment of his own
father on the ground that Zeus had chased Cronos, his
father, from the skies.</p>

<p>Homer was not only the Bible, but the schoolbook
of Grecian boys and girls throughout the world; and
their minds were saturated at an early age with the escapades
of the gods and goddesses as told by the immortal
bard. Plato, in the "Republic," deprecates the
influence of the Homeric myths upon the youth of
Greece, when he says: "They are likely to have a bad
effect on those who hear them; for everybody will
begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by
the kindred of the gods." And Seneca thus condemns
the moral effect of the myth of Zeus and Alcmene:
"What else is this appeal to the precedent of the gods
for, but to inflame our lusts, and to furnish a free license
and excuse for the corrupt act under shelter of
its divine prototype?" "This," says the same author
in another treatise, "has led to no other result than to
deprive sin of its shame in man's eyes, when he saw that
the gods were no better than himself."</p>

<p>We have seen that, in the matter of the multiplicity
of the gods, there were deities of the baser as well as
of the better passions, and of criminal as well as virtuous
propensities. Pausanias tells us that in his day, on
the road to Pellene, there were statues of Hermes
Dolios (the cheat), and that the worshipers of this
god believed that he was always ready to help them in
their intrigues and adventures. The same writer also
tells us that young maidens of Tr&#339;zene dedicated their
girdles to Athene Apaturia, the deceiver, for having
cunningly betrayed Æthra into the hands of Neptune.
The festivals of Bacchus were far-famed in ancient
times for the drunken debauches and degrading ceremonies
that accompanied them. The Attic feasts of
Pan were celebrated with every circumstance of low
buffoonery. The solemnities of the Aphrodisia were
akin to the bacchanalian orgies in all the features of
inebriety and lust. The name of the goddess of love
and beauty was blazoned across the portal of more
than one Greek and Roman brothel. The Aphrodite-Lamia
at Athens and the Aphrodite-Stratonikis at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Smyrna were the favorite resorts of the most famous
courtesans of antiquity. Venus was the recognized
goddess of the harlots. A thousand of them guarded
her temple at Corinth; and, when an altar was erected
to her at the Colline gate in Rome, in the year 183
<span class="small">A.U.C.</span>, they celebrated a great feast in her honor, and
dedicated chaplets of myrtle and roses, as a means of
obtaining her favor as the guardian divinity of their
calling.</p>

<p>What more could be expected, then, of the morality
of the Greeks and Romans, when we consider the
nature of their religion and the character of their
gods? Jupiter and Apollo were notorious rakes and
libertines; Venus and Flora were brazen-faced courtesans;
Harmonia was a Phrygian dancer, who had
been seduced by Cadmus; Hercules was a gladiator;
Pan was a buffoon; Bacchus was a drunkard, and
Mercury was a highway robber. And not only in the
poems of Homer and Hesiod did the Greek and
Roman youth learn these things, but from the plays of
the theaters and from plastic art as well. If we except
the gladiatorial fights in the amphitheaters, nothing
was more cruel and unchaste than Greek and Roman
tragedy and comedy. At the time of Christ, the tastes
and appetites of the multitude had grown so fierce and
depraved that ordinary spectacles were regarded as
commonplace and insipid. Lifelike realities were demanded
from the actors on the stage; and accordingly,
the hero who played the rôle of the robber chief,
Laureolus, was actually crucified before the spectators,
and was then torn to pieces by a hungry bear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
The burning of Hercules on Mount &#338;ta and the
emasculation of Atys were sought to be realized on the
stage by the actual burning and emasculation of condemned
criminals. Lustful as well as cruel appetites
were inflamed and fed by theatrical representations of
the intrigues and adventures of the gods and goddesses.
Pantomimes and mimic dances, with flute accompaniment,
were employed to reproduce the amours and
passionate devotions of the inhabitants of Olympus.
The guilty loves of Aphrodite with Mars and Adonis,
the adventures of Jupiter and Apollo with the wives
and daughters of mortals, were the plays most frequently
presented and most wildly applauded. And
the ignorant rabble were not the only witnesses of these
spectacles. "The sacerdotal colleges and authorities,"
says Arnobius, "flamens, and augurs, and chaste vestals,
all have seats at these public amusements. There
are seated the collective people and senate, consuls and
consulars, while Venus, the mother of the Roman race,
is danced to the life, and in shameless mimicry is represented
as reveling through all the phases of meretricious
lust. The great mother, too, is danced; the
Dindymene of Pessinus, in spite of her age, surrendering
herself to disgusting passion in the embraces of a
cowherd. The supreme ruler of the world is himself
brought in, without respect to his name or majesty, to
play the part of an adulterer, masking himself in order
to deceive chaste wives, and take the place of their
husbands in the nuptial bed."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Not only gladiatorial games and theatrical shows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>but painting and sculpture as well, served to corrupt
and demoralize Roman and Greek manners. Nor is
there any prudery in this statement. The masterpieces
of the Greek artists have been the astonishment and despair
of all succeeding ages; and the triumphs of modern
art have been but poor imitations of the models of
the first masters. But it is, nevertheless, true that the
embodiment in marble of certain obscene myths was
destructive of ancient morals. The paintings in the
temples and houses of the cities of Greece and Italy
were a constant menace to the mental purity of those
who gazed upon them. The statue of Ganymede at the
side of Zeus was a perpetual reminder to the youth of
Athens of the originator of the loathsome custom of
paiderastia. The paintings of Leda and the swan, of
the courtship of Dionysus and Ariadne, of the naked
Aphrodite ensnared and caught in the net with Ares
that adorned the walls and ceilings of Greek and Roman
homes, were not too well calculated to inspire
pure and virtuous thoughts in the minds and hearts of
tender youths and modest maidens who looked upon
and contemplated them. At Athens, especially, was
the corrupting influence of painting and plastic art
most deeply felt. "At every step," says Döllinger,
"which a Greek or Roman took, he was surrounded
by images of his gods and memorials of their mythic
history. Not the temples only, but streets and public
squares, house walls, domestic implements and drinking
vessels, were all covered and incrusted with ornaments
of the kind. His eye could rest nowhere, not a
piece of money could he take into his hand without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
confronting a god. And in this way, through the
magical omnipresence of plastic art, the memory of his
gods had sunk into his soul indelibly, grown up
with every operation of his intellect, and inseparably
blended with every picture of his imagination."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>It can thus be easily imagined how close the connection
between the social depravity and the religion of
the Greeks and Romans. What was right in the conduct
of the gods, men could not deem sinful in their
own behavior. Indeed, lewd and lascivious acts were
frequently proclaimed not only right, but sacred,
because they had been both sanctioned and committed
by the gods themselves. "As impurity," says Döllinger,
"formed a part of religion, people had no
scruples in using the temple and its adjoining buildings
for the satisfaction of their lust. The construction
of many of the temples and the prevalent gloom
favored this. 'It is a matter of general notoriety,' Tertullian
says, 'that the temples are the very places
where adulteries were arranged, and procuresses pursue
their victims between the altars.' In the chambers
of the priests and ministers of the temple, impurity
was committed amid clouds of incense; and this,
Minucius adds, more frequently than in the privileged
haunts of this sin. The sanctuaries and priests of Isis
at Rome were specially notorious in this respect. 'As
this Isis was the concubine of Jove herself, she also
makes prostitutes of others,' Ovid said. Still more
shameful sin was practiced in the temples of the Pessinuntine
mother of the gods, where men prostituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>themselves and made a boast of their shame afterwards."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><i>The Bacchanalian Orgies.</i>&mdash;The most interesting
passage of ancient literature dealing with social life in
its relation to religious observances, is an extract from
Livy, the most elegant of Roman historians. This passage
describes the bacchanalian orgies, and gives exquisite
touches to certain phases of ancient Roman
social life. Its insertion here entire is excused on the
ground of its direct bearing upon the subject matter
of this chapter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Greek of mean condition came, first, into Etruria; not
with one of the many trades which his nation, of all others
the most skilful in the cultivation of the mind and body, has
introduced among us, but a low operator in sacrifices, and a
soothsayer; nor was he one who, by open religious rites, and
by publicly professing his calling and teaching, imbued the
minds of his followers with terror, but a priest of secret
and nocturnal rites. These mysterious rites were, at first, imparted
to a few, but afterwards communicated to great
numbers, both men and women. To their religious performances
were added the pleasures of wine and feasting, to allure
a greater number of proselytes. When wine, lascivious
discourse, night, and the intercourse of the sexes had extinguished
every sentiment of modesty, then debaucheries of
every kind began to be practiced, as every person found at
hand that sort of enjoyment to which he was disposed by
the passion predominant in his nature. Nor were they confined
to one species of vice&mdash;the promiscuous intercourse of
free-born men and women, but from this store-house of villany
proceeded false witnesses, counterfeit seals, false evidences,
and pretended discoveries. From the same place, too,
proceeded poison and secret murders, so that in some cases,
even the bodies could not be found for burial. Many of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>audacious deeds were brought about by treachery, but most
of them by force; it served to conceal the violence, that on
account of the loud shouting, and the noise of drums and
cymbals, none of the cries uttered by the persons suffering
violation or murder could be heard abroad.</p></div>

</div>
<hr class="l1" />
<div class="blockquot"><p>The infection of this mischief, like that from the contagion
of disease, spread from Etruria to Rome; where, the
size of the city affording greater room for such evils, and
more means of concealment, cloaked it at first; but information
of it was at length brought to the consul, Postumius,
principally in the following manner. Publius Æbutius, whose
father had held equestrian rank in the army, was left an orphan,
and his guardians dying, he was educated under the
eye of his mother Duronia, and his stepfather Titus Sempronius
Rutilus. Duronia was entirely devoted to her husband;
and Sempronius, having managed the guardianship in
such a manner that he could not give an account of the property,
wished that his ward should be either made away with,
or bound to compliance with his will by some strong tie.
The Bacchanalian rites were the only way to effect the ruin
of the youth. His mother told him, that, "During his sickness,
she had made a vow for him, that if he should recover,
she would initiate him among the Bacchanalians; that being,
through the kindness of the gods, bound by this vow, she
wished now to fulfil it; that it was necessary he should preserve
chastity for ten days, and on the tenth, after he should
have supped and washed himself, she would conduct him
into the place of worship." There was a freedwoman called
Hispala Fecenia, a noted courtesan, but deserving of a better
lot than the mode of life to which she had been accustomed
when very young, and a slave, and by which she had
maintained herself since her manumission. As they lived in
the same neighborhood, an intimacy subsisted between her
and Æbutius, which was far from being injurious either to
the young man's character or property; for he had been loved
and wooed by her unsolicited; and as his friends supplied
his wants illiberally, he was supported by the generosity of
this woman; nay, to such a length did she go under the influence
of her affection, that, on the death of her patron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>because she was under the protection of no one, having petitioned
the tribunes and prætors for a guardian, when she
was making her will, she constituted Æbutius her sole heir.</p>

<p>As such pledges of mutual love subsisted, and as neither
kept anything secret from the other, the young man jokingly
bid her not be surprised if he separated himself from her
for a few nights, as, "on account of a religious duty, to
discharge a vow made for his health, he intended to be initiated
among the Bacchanalians." On hearing this, the
woman, greatly alarmed, cried out, "May the gods will
more favorably!" affirming that "It would be better, both
for him and her, to lose their lives than that he should do
such a thing:" she then imprecated curses, vengeance, and
destruction on the head of those who advised him to such a
step. The young man, surprised both at her expressions and
at the violence of her alarm, bid her refrain from curses,
for "it was his mother who ordered him to do so, with the
approbation of his stepfather." "Then," said she, "your
stepfather (for perhaps it is not allowable to censure your
mother), is in haste to destroy, by that act, your chastity,
your character, your hopes and your life." To him, now
surprised by such language, and inquiring what was the matter,
she said, (after imploring the favor and pardon of the
gods and goddesses, if, compelled by her regard for him,
she disclosed what ought not to be revealed), that "when
in service, she had gone into that place of worship, as an
attendant on her mistress, but that, since she had obtained
her liberty, she had never once gone near it: that she knew
it to be the receptacle of all kinds of debaucheries; that it
was well known that, for two years past, no one older than
twenty had been initiated there. When any person was introduced
he was delivered as a victim to the priests, who led
him away to a place resounding with shouts, the sound of
music, and the beating of cymbals and drums, lest his cries
while suffering violation, should be heard abroad." She
then entreated and besought him to put an end to that matter
in some way or other, and not to plunge himself into a situation,
where he must first suffer, and afterwards commit,
everything that was abominable. Nor did she quit him until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>the young man gave her his promise to keep himself clear of
those rites.</p>

<p>When he came home, and his mother made mention of
such things pertaining to the ceremony as were to be performed
on that day, and on the several following days, he
told her that he would not perform any of them, nor did
he intend to be initiated. His stepfather was present at this
discourse. Immediately the woman observed that "he could
not deprive himself of the company of Hispala for ten
nights; that he was so fascinated by the caresses and baneful
influence of that serpent, that he retained no respect for his
mother or stepfather, or even the gods themselves." His
mother on one side and his stepfather on the other loading
him with reproaches, drove him out of the house, assisted
by four slaves. The youth on this repaired to his aunt
Æbutia, told her the reason of his being turned out by his
mother, and the next day, by her advice, gave information
of the affair to the consul Postumius, without any witnesses
of the interview. The consul dismissed him, with an order
to come again on the third day following. In the meantime,
he inquired of his mother-in-law, Sulpicia, a woman of respectable
character, "whether she knew an old matron called
Æbutia, who lived on the Aventine hill?" When she had
answered that "she knew her well, and that Æbutia was a
woman of virtue, and of the ancient purity of morals;" he
said that he required a conference with her, and that a messenger
should be sent for her to come. Æbutia, on receiving
the message, came to Sulpicia's house, and the consul, soon
after, coming in, as if by accident, introduced a conversation
about Æbutius, her brother's son. The tears of the woman
burst forth, and she began to lament the unhappy lot of the
youth: who after being robbed of his property by persons
whom it least of all became, was then residing with her,
being driven out of doors by his mother, because, being a
good youth (may the gods be propitious to him), he refused
to be initiated in ceremonies devoted to lewdness, as report
goes.</p>

<p>The consul thinking that he had made sufficient inquiries
concerning Æbutius, and that his testimony was unquestionable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>having dismissed Æbutia, requested his mother-in-law
to send again to the Aventine, and bring from that quarter
Hispala, a freedwoman, not unknown in that neighborhood;
for there were some queries which he wished to make of
her. Hispala being alarmed because she was being sent for
by a woman of such high rank and respectable character, and
being ignorant of the cause, after she saw the lictors in the
porch, the multitude attending to the consul and the consul
himself, was very near fainting. The consul led her into
the retired part of the house, and, in the presence of his
mother-in-law, told her, that she need not be uneasy, if she
could resolve to speak the truth. She might receive a promise
of protection either from Sulpicia, a matron of such dignified
character, or from himself. That she ought to tell
him, what was accustomed to be done at the Bacchanalia, in
the nocturnal orgies in the grove of Stimula. When the
woman heard this, such terror and trembling of all her limbs
seized her, that for a long time she was unable to speak; but
recovering at length she said, that "when she was very young,
and a slave, she had been initiated, together with her mistress;
but for several years past, since she had obtained her
liberty, she knew nothing of what was done there." The
consul commended her so far, as not having denied that she
was initiated, but charged her to explain all the rest with
the same sincerity; and told her, affirming that she knew
nothing further, that "there would not be the same tenderness
or pardon extended to her, if she should be convicted
by another person, and one who had made a voluntary confession;
that there was such a person, who had heard the
whole from her, and had given him a full account of it."</p>

<p>The woman, now thinking without a doubt that it must
certainly be Æbutius who had discovered the secret, threw
herself at Sulpicia's feet, and at first began to beseech her,
"not to let the private conversation of a freedwoman with
her lover be turned not only into a serious business, but even
capital charge;" declaring that "she had spoken of such
things merely to frighten him, and not because she knew anything
of the kind." On this Postumius, growing angry, said
"she seemed to imagine that then too she was wrangling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>with her gallant Æbutius, and not that she was speaking in
the house of a most respectable matron, and to a consul."
Sulpicia raised her, terrified, from the ground, and while she
encouraged her to speak out, at the same time pacified her
son-in-law's anger. At length she took courage, and, having
censured severely the perfidy of Æbutius, because he had
made such a return for the extraordinary kindness shown to
him in that very instance, she declared that "she stood in
great dread of the gods, whose secret mysteries she was to
divulge; and in much greater dread of the men implicated,
who would tear her asunder with their hands if she became
an informer. Therefore she entreated this favor of Sulpicia,
and likewise of the consul, that they would send her away
some place out of Italy, where she might pass the remainder
of her life in safety." The consul desired her to be of good
spirits, and said that it should be his care that she might live
securely in Rome.</p>

<p>Hispala then gave a full account of the origin of the mysteries.
"At first," she said, "those rites were performed by
women. No man used to be admitted. They had three
stated days in the year on which such persons were initiated
among the Bacchanalians, in the daytime. The matrons used
to be appointed priestesses, in rotation. Paculla Minia, a
Campanian, when priestess, made an alteration in every particular
as if by the direction of the gods. For she first
introduced men, who were her own sons, Minucius and Herrenius,
both surnamed Cerrinius; changed the time of celebration,
from day to night; and, instead of three days in
the year, appointed five days of initiation in each month.
From the time that the rites were thus made common, and
men were intermixed with women, and the licentious freedom
of the night was added, there was nothing wicked,
nothing flagitious, that had not been practiced among them.
There were more frequent pollution of men, with each other,
than with women. If any were less patient in submitting
to dishonor, or more averse to the commission of vice, they
were sacrificed as victims. To think nothing unlawful, was
the grand maxim of their religion. The men, as if bereft
of reason, uttered predictions, with frantic contortions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>their bodies; the women, in the habit of Bacchantes, with
their hair dishevelled, and carrying blazing torches, ran down
to the Tiber; where, dipping their torches in the water, they
drew them up again with the flame unextinguished, being
composed of native sulphur and charcoal. They said that
those men were carried off by the gods, whom the machines
laid hold of and dragged from their view into secret caves.
These were such as refused to take the oath of the society or
to associate in their crimes, or to submit to defilement. Their
number was exceedingly great now, almost a second state in
themselves and among them were many men and women of
noble families. During the last two years it had been a rule,
that no person above the age of twenty should be initiated,
for they sought for people of such age as made them more
liable to suffer deception and personal abuse." When she
had completed her information, she again fell at the consul's
knees, and repeated the same entreaties, that he might send
her out of the country. The consul requested his mother-in-law
to clear some part of the house, into which Hispala might
remove; accordingly an apartment was assigned her in the
upper part of it, of which the stairs, opening into the street,
were stopped up, and the entrance made from the inner court.
Thither all Fecenia's effects were immediately removed, and
her domestics sent for. Æbutius, also, was ordered to remove
to the house of one of the consul's clients.</p>

<p>When both the informers were by these means in his power,
Postumius represented the affair to the senate, laying before
them the whole circumstance, in due order; the information
given to him at first, and the discoveries gained by his inquiries
afterwards. Great consternation seized on the senators;
not only on the public account, lest such conspiracies
and nightly meetings might be productive of secret treachery
and mischief, but, likewise, on account of their own particular
families, lest some of their relations might be involved in
this infamous affair. The senate voted, however, that thanks
should be given to the consul because he had investigated the
matter with singular diligence, and without exciting any
alarm. They then commit to the consuls the holding an inquiry,
out of the common course, concerning the Bacchanals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>and their nocturnal orgies. They ordered them to take care
that the informers, Æbutius and Fecenia, might suffer no
injury on that account; and to invite other informers in the
matter, by offering rewards. They ordered that the officials
in those rites, whether men or women, should be sought for,
not only at Rome, but also throughout all the market towns
and places of assembly, and be delivered over to the power
of the consuls; and also that proclamation should be made in
the city of Rome, and published through all Italy, that
"no persons initiated in the Bacchanalian rites should presume
to come together or assemble on account of those rites,
or to perform any such kind of worship;" and above all,
that search should be made for those who had assembled or
conspired for personal abuse, or for any other flagitious practices.
The senate passed these decrees. The consuls directed
the curule ædiles to make strict inquiry after all the priests
of those mysteries, and to keep such as they could apprehend
in custody until their trial; they at the same time charged
the plebeian ædiles to take care that no religious ceremonies
should be performed in private. To the capital triumvirs the
task was assigned to post watches in proper places in the
city, and to use vigilance in preventing any meetings by
night. In order likewise to guard against fires, five assistants
were joined to the triumvirs, so that each might have
the charge of the buildings in his own separate district, on
this side the Tiber.</p>

<p>After despatching these officers to their several employments,
the consuls mounted the rostrum; and, having summoned
an assembly of the people, one of the consuls, when
he had finished the solemn form of prayer which the magistrates
are accustomed to pronounce before they address the
people, proceeded thus: "Romans, to no former assembly
was this solemn supplication to the gods more suitable or
even more necessary: as it serves to remind you, that these
are the deities whom your forefathers pointed out as the
objects of your worship, veneration and prayers: and not
those which infatuated men's minds with corrupt and foreign
modes of religion, and drove them, as if goaded by the furies,
to every lust and every vice. I am at a loss to know what I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>should conceal, or how far I ought to speak out; for I dread
lest, if I leave you ignorant of any particular, I should give
room for carelessness, or if I disclose the whole, that I
should too much awaken your fears. Whatever I shall say,
be assured that it is less than the magnitude and atrociousness
of the affair would justify: exertions will be used by us that
it may be sufficient to set us properly on our guard. That
the Bacchanalian rites have subsisted for some time past in
every country in Italy, and are at present performed in many
parts of this city also, I am sure you must have been informed,
not only by report, but by the nightly noises and the
horrid yells that resound through the whole city; but still
you are ignorant of the nature of that business. Part of you
think it is some kind of worship of the gods; others, some
excusable sport and amusement, and that whatever it may
be, it concerns but a few. As regards the number if I tell
you that there are many thousands, that you would be immediately
terrified to excess is a necessary consequence; unless
I further acquaint you who and what sort of persons they
are. First, then, a great part of them are women, and this
was the source of the evil; the rest are males, but nearly
resembling women; actors and pathics in the vilest lewdness;
night revellers, driven frantic by wine, noise of instruments,
and clamors. The conspiracy, as yet, has no strength; but
it has abundant means of acquiring strength, for they are
becoming more numerous every day. Your ancestors would
not allow that you should ever assemble casually without
some good reason; that is, either when the standard was
erected on the Janiculum, and the army led out on occasion
of elections; or when the tribunes proclaimed a meeting of
the commons, or some of the magistrates summoned you to
it. And they judged it necessary, that wherever a multitude
was, there should be a lawful governor of that multitude
present. Of what kind do you suppose are the meetings
of these people? In the first place, held in the night,
and in the next, composed promiscuously of men and women.
If you knew at what ages the males are initiated, you would
feel not only pity, but also shame for them. Romans, can
you think youths initiated, under such oaths as theirs, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>fit to be made soldiers? That arms should be intrusted with
wretches brought out of that temple of obscenity? Shall
these, contaminated with their own foul debaucheries and
those of others, be champions for the chastity of your wives
and children?</p>

<p>"But the mischief were less, if they were only effeminated
by their practices; or that the disgrace would chiefly affect
themselves; if they refrained their hands from outrage, and
their thoughts from fraud. But never was there in the state
an evil of so great magnitude, or one that extended to so
many persons or so many acts of wickedness. Whatever
deeds of villany have, during late years been committed
through lust; whatever through fraud; whatever through
violence; they have all, be assured, proceeded from that
association alone. They have not yet perpetrated all the
crimes for which they combine. The impious assembly at
present confines itself to outrages on private citizens; because
it has not yet acquired force sufficient to crush the
commonwealth: but the evil increases and spreads daily; it
is already too great for the private ranks of life to contain
it, and aims its views at the body of the state. Unless you
take timely precautions, Romans, their nightly assembly may
become as large as this, held in open day and legally summoned
by a consul. Now they one by one dread you collected
together in the assembly; presently, when you shall have
separated and retired to your several dwellings, in town and
country, they will again come together, and will hold a consultation
on the means of their own safety, and, at the same
time, of your destruction. Thus united, they will cause terror
to every one of you. Each of you therefore, ought to pray
that his kindred may have behaved with wisdom and prudence;
and if lust, if madness, has dragged any of them into
that abyss, to consider such a person as the relation of those
with whom he has conspired for every disgraceful and reckless
act, and not as one of your own. I am not secure, lest
some even of yourselves may have erred through mistake;
for nothing is more deceptive in appearance than false religion.
When the authority of the gods is held out as a
pretext to cover vice, fear enters our minds, lest in punishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>the crimes of men, we may violate some divine right
connected therewith. Numberless decisions of the pontiffs,
decrees of the senate, and even answers of the aruspices,
free you from religious scruples of this character. How
often in the ages of our fathers was it given in charge to
the magistrates, to prohibit the performances of any foreign
religious rites; to banish strolling sacrificers and soothsayers
from the Forum, the circus and the city; to search for and
burn books of divination; and to abolish every mode of sacrificing
that was not conformable to the Roman practice!
For they, completely versed in every divine and human law,
maintained that nothing tended so strongly to the subversion
of religion as sacrifice, when we offered it not after the institutions
of our forefathers, but after foreign customs. Thus
much I thought necessary to mention to you beforehand, that
no vain scruple might disturb your minds when you should
see us demolishing the places resorted to by the Bacchanalians,
and dispersing their impious assemblies. We shall do
all these things with the favor and approbation of the gods;
who, because they were indignant that their divinity was dishonored
by those people's lust and crimes, have drawn forth
their proceedings from hidden darkness into the open light;
and who have directed them to be exposed, not that they
may escape with impunity, but in order that they may be
punished and suppressed. The senate have committed to me
and my colleague, an inquisition extraordinary concerning
that affair. What is requisite to be done by ourselves, in
person, we will do with energy. The charge of posting
watches through the city, during the night, we have committed
to the inferior magistrates; and, for your parts, it is
incumbent on you to execute vigorously whatever duties are
assigned you, and in the several places where each will
be placed, to perform whatever orders you shall receive, and
to use your best endeavors that no danger or tumult may arise
from the treachery of the party involved in the guilt."</p>

<p>They then ordered the decrees of the senate to be read,
and published a reward for any discoverer who should bring
any of the guilty before them, or give information against
any of the absent, adding, that "if any person accused should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>fly, they would limit a certain day upon which, if he did not
answer when summoned, he would be condemned in his absence;
and if anyone should be charged who was out of Italy,
they would not allow him any longer time, if he should wish
to come and make his defence." They then issued an edict,
that "no person whatever should presume to buy or sell anything
for the purpose of leaving the country; or to receive
or conceal, or by any means aid the fugitives." On the
assembly being dismissed, great terror spread throughout the
city; nor was it confined merely within the walls, or to
the Roman territory, for everywhere throughout the whole
of Italy alarm began to be felt&mdash;when the letters from the
guest-friends were received&mdash;concerning the decree of the
senate, and what passed in the assembly and the edict of the
consuls. During the night, which succeeded the day in which
the affair was made public, great numbers attempting to fly,
were seized and bought back by the triumvirs, who had
posted guards at all the gates; and informations were lodged
against many, some of whom, both men and women, put
themselves to death. Above seven thousand men and women
are said to have taken the oath of the association. But it
appeared that the heads of the conspiracy were the two
Catinii, Marcus and Caius, Roman plebeians; Lucius Opiturnius,
a Faliscian; and Minius Cerrinius, a Campanian:
that from these proceeded all their criminal practices, and
that these were the chief priests and founders of the sect.
Care was taken that they should be apprehended as soon
as possible. They were brought before the consuls, and confessing
their guilt, caused no delay to the ends of justice.</p>

<p>But so great were the numbers that fled from the city, that
because the lawsuits and property of many persons were going
to ruin, the prætors, Titius Mænius and Marcus Licinius
were obliged, under the direction of the senate, to adjourn
their courts for thirty days until the inquiries should be finished
by the consuls. The same deserted state of the law
courts, since the persons against whom charges were brought
did not appear to answer, nor could be found in Rome, necessitated
the consuls to make a circuit of the country towns,
and there to make their inquisitions and hold the trials.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>Those who, as it appeared, had been only initiated, and had
made after the priest, and in the most solemn form, the prescribed
imprecations, in which the accursed conspiracy for
the perpetration of every crime and lust was contained, but
who had not themselves committed, or compelled others to
commit, any of those acts to which they were bound by the
oath&mdash;all such they left in prison. But those who had forcibly
committed personal defilements or murders, or were
stained with the guilt of false evidence, counterfeit seals,
forged wills, or other frauds, all these they punished with
death. A greater number were executed than thrown into
prison; indeed the multitude of men and women who suffered
in both ways, was very considerable. The consuls delivered
the women who were condemned to their relations, or to
those under whose guardianship they were, that they might
inflict the punishment in private; but if there did not appear
any proper person of the kind to execute the sentence, the
punishment was inflicted in public. A charge was then given
to demolish all the places where the Bacchanalians had held
their meetings; first, in Rome, and then throughout all Italy;
excepting those wherein should be found some ancient altar,
or consecrated statue. With regard to the future, the senate
passed a decree, "that no Bacchanalian rites should be celebrated
in Rome or in Italy:" and ordering that, "in case
any person should believe some such kind of worship incumbent
upon him, and necessary; and that he could not,
without offence to religion, and incurring guilt, omit it, he
should represent this to the city prætor, and the prætor should
lay the business before the senate. If permission were granted
by the senate, when not less than one hundred members were
present, then he might perform those rites, provided that no
more than five persons should be present at the sacrifice, and
that they should have no common stock of money, nor any
president of the ceremonies, nor priest."</p>

<p>Another decree connected with this was then made, on a
motion of the consul, Quintus Marcius, that "the business
respecting the persons who had served the consuls as informers
should be proposed to the senate in its original form,
when Spurius Postumius should have finished his inquiries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>and returned to Rome." They voted that Minus Cerrinius,
the Campanian, should be sent to Ardea, to be kept in custody
there; and that a caution should be given to the magistrates
of that city, to guard him with more than ordinary
care, so as to prevent not only his escaping, but his having
an opportunity of committing suicide.</p>

<p>Spurius Postumius some time after came to Rome and on
his proposing the question, concerning the reward to be given
to Publius Æbutius and Hispala Fecenia, because the Bacchanalian
ceremonies were discovered by their exertions, the
senate passed a vote, that "the city quæstors should give
to each of them, out of the public treasury, one hundred
thousand asses; and that the consuls should desire the plebeian
tribunes to propose to the commons as soon as convenient,
that the campaigns of Publius Æbutius should be
considered as served, that he should not become a soldier
against his wishes, nor should any censor assign him a horse
at the public charge." They voted also, that "Hispala
Fecenia should enjoy the privileges of alienating her property
by gift or deed; of marrying out of her rank, and of
choosing a guardian, as if a husband had conferred them
by will; that she should be at liberty to wed a man of honorable
birth, and that there should be no disgrace or ignominy
to him who should marry her; and that the consuls
and prætors then in office, and their successors, should take
care that no injury should be offered to that woman, and
that she might live in safety. That the senate wishes, and
thought proper, that all these things should be so ordered."&mdash;All
these particulars were proposed to the commons, and
executed, according to the vote of the senate; and full permission
was given to the consuls to determine respecting the
impunity and rewards of the other informers.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p></div>

<p>The bacchanalian orgies were first suppressed nearly
two hundred years before Christ. The above extract
from Livy reminds us that at that time the Romans
were still strong and virtuous, and that a proposal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>their Consul to eradicate a vicious evil that threatened
the existence of both domestic life and the State, met
with warm approval and hearty support from both the
Senate and the people. But the insidious infection
was never completely eradicated; and the work of the
"Greek from Etruria" bore bitter fruit in the centuries
that followed. And when we consider that not
only bacchanalian orgies, but Greek literature, painting,
sculpture, tragedy and comedy, were the chief
causes of the pollution of Roman morals and the destruction
of the Roman State, should we be surprised
that Juvenal, in an outburst of patriotic wrath, should
have declaimed against "a Grecian capital in Italy";<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
and that he should have hurled withering scorn at</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The flattering, cringing, treacherous, artful race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fluent tongue and never-blushing face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Protean tribe, one knows not what to call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shifts to every form, and shines in all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, when we consider the state of the Roman
world at the time of Christ, should we be surprised
that St. Paul should have described Romans as "Being
filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,
debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters,
haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors
of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding,
covenant-breakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful"?<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>Suffice it to say, in closing the chapter on Græco-Roman
paganism, that, at the beginning of the Christian
era, the Roman empire had reached the limit of
physical expansion. Roman military glory had culminated
in the sublime achievements of Pompey and of
Cæsar. Mountains, seas, and deserts, beyond which
all was barbarous and desolate, were the natural barriers
of Roman dominion. Roman arms could go no
farther; and Roman ambition could be no longer
gratified by conquest. The Roman religion had fallen
into decay and contempt; and the Roman conscience
was paralyzed and benumbed. Disgusted with this
world, the average Roman did not believe in any other,
and was utterly without hope of future happiness. A
gloomy despondency filled the hearts of men and
drove them into black despair. When approaching
death, they wore no look of triumph, expressed no
belief in immortality, but simply requested of those
whom they were leaving behind, to scatter flowers on
their graves, or to bewail their early end. An epigram
of the Anthology is this: "Let us drink and be merry;
for we shall have no more of kissing and dancing in
the kingdom of Proserpine: soon shall we fall asleep
to wake no more." The same sentiments are expressed
in epitaphs on Roman sepulchral monuments of the
period. One of them reads thus: "What I have eaten
and drunk, that I take with me; what I have left behind
me, that have I forfeited." This is the language
of another: "Reader, enjoy thy life; for after death
there is neither laughter nor play, nor any kind of
enjoyment." Still another: "Friend, I advise, mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
thee a goblet of wine, and drink, crowning thy head
with flowers. Earth and fire consume all that remains
after death." And, finally, one of them assures us that
Greek mythology is false: "Pilgrim, stay thee, listen
and learn. In Hades there is no ferryboat, nor ferryman
Charon; no Æacus or Cerberus;&mdash;once dead, and
we are all alike."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Matthew Arnold has very graphically described the
disgusting, sickening, overwhelming despair of the
Roman people at the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>But the "darkest hour is just before the dawn," and
"the fulness of the time was come." Already the first
faint glimmers of the breaking of a grander and better
day were perceptible to the senses of the noblest and
finest of Roman intellects. Already Cicero had pictured
a glorious millennium that would follow if perfect
virtue should ever enter into the flesh and come to
dwell among men.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Already Virgil, deriving inspiration

in the anguish of its soul: "I know that my Redeemer

in the wilderness, the ways had been made straight for
the coming of the Nazarene.</p>

CHARACTERS OF THE SANHEDRISTS WHO TRIED JESUS</h3>

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE following short biographical
sketches of about forty of the
members of the Sanhedrin who
tried Jesus are from a work entitled
"Valeur de l'assemblée qui
prononça la peine de mort contre
Jésus Christ"&mdash;Lémann. The

<h4><span class="smcap">The Moral Characters of the Personages who
Sat at the Trial of Christ</span></h4>

<p>The members of the Sanhedrin that judged Christ
were seventy-one in number, and were divided into
three chambers; but we must know the names, acts,
and moral characters of these judges. That such a
knowledge would throw a great light on this celebrated
trial can be easily understood. The characters
of Caiaphas, Ananos, and Pilate are already well
known to us. These stand out as the three leading figures
in the drama of the Passion. But others have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
appeared in it; would it not be possible to produce
them also before history? This task, we believe, has
never yet been undertaken. It was thought that
documents were wanting. But this is an error; such
documents exist. We have consulted them; and in
this century of historical study and research we shall
draw forth from the places where they have been
hidden for centuries, the majority of the judges of
Christ.</p>

<p>Three kinds of documents have, in a particular manner,
enabled us to discover the characters of these men:
the books of the Evangelists, the valuable writings of
Josephus the historian, and the hitherto unexplored
pages of the Talmud. We shall bring to light forty
of the judges, so that more than half of the Sanhedrin
will appear before us; and this large majority will be
sufficient to enable us to form an opinion of the moral
tone of the whole assembly.</p>

<p>To proceed with due order, we will begin with the
most important chamber&mdash;viz., the chamber of the
priests.</p>

<h5>I. <span class="smcap">The Chamber of the Priests</span></h5>

<p>We use the expression "chamber of the <i>priests</i>." In
the Gospel narrative, however, this division of the Sanhedrin
bears a more imposing title. Matthew, Mark,
and the other Evangelists, designate it by the following
names: the council <i>of the high priests</i>, and the council
<i>of the princes of the priests</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
But we may ask, Why is this pompous name given
to this chamber by the Evangelists? Is this not an error
on their part? An assembly of priests seems natural,
but how can there be an assembly of high priests, since
according to the Mosaic institution there could be only
one high priest, whose office was tenable for life. There
is, however, neither an error nor an undue amplification
on the part of the Gospel narrators; and we may
also add here that both Talmuds positively speak of
an assembly of high priests.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> But how, then, can we
account for the presence of several high priests at the
same time in the Sanhedrin? Here is the explanation,
to the shame of the Jewish assembly:</p>

<p>For nearly a century a detestable abuse prevailed,
which consisted in the arbitrary nomination and deposition
of the high priest. The high priesthood, which
for fifteen centuries had been preserved in the same
family, being hereditary according to the divine command,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
had at the time of Christ's advent become an
object of commercial speculation. Herod commenced
these arbitrary changes,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and after Judea became one
of the Roman conquests the election of the high priest
took place almost every year at Jerusalem, the procurators
appointing and deposing them in the same manner
as the prætorians later on made and unmade
emperors.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The Talmud speaks sorrowfully of this
venality and the yearly changes of the high priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>This sacred office was given to the one that offered
the most money for it, and mothers were particularly
anxious that their sons should be nominated to this
dignity.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The expression, "<i>the council of the high priests</i>,"
used by the Evangelists to designate this section of the
Sanhedrin, is therefore rigorously correct; for at the
time of the trial of Christ there were about twelve ex-high
priests, who still retained the honorable title of
their charge, and were, by the right of that title, members
of the high tribunal. Several ordinary priests
were also included in this chamber, but they were in
most cases related to the high priests; for in the midst
of the intrigues by which the sovereign pontificate was
surrounded in those days, it was customary for the more
influential of the chief priests to bring in their sons
and allies as members of their chamber. The spirit
of caste was very powerful, and as M. Dérembourg,
a modern Jewish savant, has remarked: "<i>A few priestly,
aristocratic, powerful, and vain families, who cared
for neither the dignity nor the interests of the altar,
quarreled with each other respecting appointments, influence,
and wealth</i>."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>To sum up, we have, then, in this first chamber
a double element&mdash;high priests and ordinary priests.
We shall now make them known by their names and
characters, and indicate the sources whence the information
has been obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span><span class="smcap">Caiaphas</span>, high priest then in office. He was the
son-in-law of Ananos, and exercised his office for eleven
years&mdash;during the whole term of Pilate's administration
(25-36 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). It is he who presided over the
Sanhedrin during this trial, and the history of the
Passion as given by the Evangelists is sufficient to
make him known to us. (See Matt. xxvi. 3; Luke
iii. 2, etc.; Jos., "Ant.," B. XVIII. C. II. 2.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ananos</span> held the office of high priest for seven years
under Coponius, Ambivus, and Rufus (7-11 <span class="small">A.D.</span>).
This personage was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, and
although out of office was nevertheless consulted on
matters of importance. It may be said, indeed, that
in the midst of the instability of the sacerdotal office
he alone preserved in reality its authority. For fifty
years this high office remained without interruption
in his family. Five of his sons successively assumed
its dignity. This family was even known as the "sacerdotal
family," as if this office had become hereditary
in it. Ananos had charge also of the more important
duties of the Temple, and Josephus says that he was
considered the most fortunate man of his time. He
adds, however, that the spirit of this family was
haughty, audacious, and cruel. (Luke iii. 2; John
xviii. 13, 24; Acts iv. 6; Jos., "Ant.," B. XV. C. III 1;
XX. IX. 1, 3; "Jewish Wars," B. IV. V. 2, 6, 7.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eleazar</span> was high priest during one year, under
Valerius Grattus (23-24 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). He was the eldest son
of Ananos. (Jos., "Ant.," B. XVIII. II. 2.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, son of Ananos, simple priest at that time,
but afterwards made high priest for one year in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
place of Caiaphas when the latter was deposed, after
the disgrace of Pilate, by Vitellius, Governor-general
of Syria (37 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). (Jos., "Ant.," B. XVIII. IV. 3.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theophilus</span>, son of Ananos, simple priest at that
time, but afterwards made high priest in the place of
his brother Jonathan, who was deposed by Vitellius.
Theophilus was in office five years (38-42 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). (Jos.,
"Ant.," B. XIX. VI. 2; Munk, "Hist. de la Palestine," p. 568.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthias</span>, son of Ananos. Simple priest; afterwards
high priest for two years (42-44 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). He succeeded
Simon Cantharus, who was deposed by King
Herod Agrippa. (Jos., "Ant.," XIX. VI. 4.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ananus</span>, son of Ananos. Simple priest at the time;
afterwards made high priest by Herod Agrippa after
the death of the Roman governor, Portius Festus (63
<span class="small">A.D.</span>). Being a Sadducee of extravagant zeal, he was
deposed at the end of three months by Albanus, successor
of Portius Festus, for having illegally condemned
the apostle James to be stoned. (Acts xxiii. 2, xxiv. 1;
Jos., "Ant.," B. XX. IX. 1.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joazar</span>, high priest for six years during the latter
days of Herod the Great and the first years of Archelaus
(4 <span class="small">B.C.</span>-2 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). He was the son of Simon Boethus,
who owed his dignity and fortune to the following
dishonorable circumstance, as related by Josephus the
historian: "There was one Simon, a citizen of Jerusalem,
the son of Boethus, a citizen of Alexandria and
a priest of great note there. This man had a daughter,
who was esteemed the most beautiful woman of that
time. And when the people of Jerusalem began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
speak much in her commendation, it happened that
Herod was much affected by what was said of her;
and when he saw the damsel he was smitten with her
beauty. Yet did he entirely reject the thought of using
his authority to abuse her ... so he thought it best
to take the damsel to wife. And while Simon was of
a dignity too inferior to be allied to him, but still too
considerable to be despised, he governed his inclinations
after the most prudent manner by augmenting
the dignity of the family and making them more honorable.
Accordingly he forthwith deprived Jesus, the
son of Phabet, of the high priesthood, and conferred
that dignity on Simon." Such, according to Josephus,
is the origin&mdash;not at all of a supernatural nature&mdash;of
the call to the high priesthood of Simon Boethus
and his whole family. Simon, at the time of this trial,
was already dead; but Joazar figured in it with two
of his brothers, one of whom was, like himself, an
ex-high priest. (Jos., "Ant.," B. XV. IX. 3; XVII.
VI. 4; XVIII. I. 1; XIX. VI. 2.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eleazar</span>, second son of Simon Boethus. He succeeded
his brother Joazar when the latter was deprived
of that function by King Archelaus (2 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). Eleazar
was high priest for a short time only, the same king
deposing him three months after his installation. (Jos.,
"Ant.," B. XVII. XIII. 1; XIX. VI. 2.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon Cantharus</span>, third son of Simon Boethus.
Simple priest at the time; was afterwards made high
priest by King Herod Agrippa (42 <span class="small">A.D.</span>), who, however,
deposed him after a few months. (Jos., "Ant.,"
B. XIX. VI. 2, 4.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Sie</span> succeeded Eleazar to the high priesthood,
and held the office for five or six years (1-6 <span class="small">A.D.</span>)
under the reign of Archelaus. (Jos., "Ant.," XVII.
XIII. 1.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ismael</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Phabi</span>. High priest for nine years under
procurator Valerius Grattus, predecessor of Pontius
Pilate. He was considered, according to the rabbins,
the handsomest man of his time. The effeminate
love of luxury of this chief priest was carried to such
an extent that his mother, having made him a tunic
of great price, he deigned to wear it once, and then
consigned it to the public wardrobe, as a grand lady
might dispose of a robe which no longer pleased her
caprices. ("Talmud," "Pesachim," or "of the Passover,"
fol. 57, verso; "Yoma," or "the Day of Atonement,"
fol. 9, verso; 35, recto; Jos., "Ant.," XVIII.
II. 2; XX. VIII. 11; Bartolocci, "Grand Bibliothèque
Rabbinique," T. III. p. 297; Munk, "Palestine," pp.
563, 575.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Camithus</span>, high priest during one year
under procurator Valerius Grattus (24-25 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). This
personage was celebrated for the enormous size of his
hand, and the Talmud relates of him the following
incident: On the eve of the day of atonement it happened,
in the course of a conversation which he had
with Arathus, King of Arabia&mdash;whose daughter Herod
Antipas had just married&mdash;that some saliva, coming
out of the mouth of the king, fell on the robe of
Simon. As soon as the king left him, he hastened to
divest himself of it, considering it desecrated by the
circumstance, and hence unworthy to be worn during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the services of the following day. What a remarkable
instance of Pharisaical purity and charity! ("Talmud,"
"Yoma," or "the Day of Atonement," fol. 47,
verso; Jos., "Ant.," XVIII. II. 2; Dérembourg, "Essai
sur l'histoire," p. 197, n. 2.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>, simple priest. He is made known to us
through the Acts of the Apostles. "And Annas the
high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander,
and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest,
were gathered together in Jerusalem." (Acts iv. 6.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander</span>, simple priest; also mentioned in the
Acts of the Apostles in the passage above quoted. Josephus
also makes mention of him, and says that he
afterwards became an <i>Alabarch</i>&mdash;that is to say, first
magistrate of the Jews in Alexandria. That he was
very rich is to be learned from the fact that King
Herod Agrippa asked and obtained from him the loan
of two hundred thousand pieces of silver. (Acts iv. 6;
Jos., "Ant.," XVIII. VI. 3; XX. V. 2; Petri Wesselingii,

ad Rhenum, pp. 69-71.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ananias</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Nebedeus</span>, simple priest at that time;
was elected to the high priesthood under procurators
Ventideus, Cumanus, and Felix (48-54 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). He is
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles and by Josephus.
It was this high priest who delivered the apostle Paul
to procurator Felix. "Ananias the high priest descended
with the elders, and with a certain orator
named Tertullus, who informed the governor against
Paul." (Acts xxiv. 1.) According to Jewish tradition,
this high priest is chiefly known for his excessive gluttony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
What the Talmud says of his voracity is
quite phenomenal. It mentions three hundred calves,
as many casks of wine, and forty pairs of young pigeons
as having been brought together for his repast. ("Talmud,"
Bab., "Pesachim," or "of the Passover," fol. 57,
verso; "Kerihoth," or "Sins which Close the Entrance
to Eternal Life," fol. 28, verso; Jos., "Ant.," XX. V.
2; Dérembourg, work quoted above, pp. 230, 234;
Munk, "Palestine," p. 573, n. 1.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helcias</span>, simple priest, and keeper of the treasury
of the Temple. It is probably from him that Judas
Iscariot received the thirty pieces of silver, the price
of his treason. (Jos., "Ant.," XX. VIII. 11.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sceva</span>, one of the principal priests. He is spoken
of in the Acts apropos of his seven sons, who gave
themselves up to witchcraft. (Acts xix. 13, 14.)</p>

<p>Such are the chief priests that constituted the first
chamber of the Sanhedrin at the time of the trial of
Christ.</p>

<p>From the documents which we have consulted and
the résumé which we have just given, we gather:</p>

<p>1. That several of the high priests were personally
dishonorable.</p>

<p>2. That all these high priests, who succeeded each
other annually in the Aaronic office in utter disregard
of the order established by God, were but miserable
intruders. We trust that these expressions will not offend
our dear Israelitish readers, for they are based
on the statements of eminent and zealous Jewish
writers.</p>

<p>To begin with Josephus the historian. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
endeavoring to conceal as much as possible the shameful
acts committed by the priests composing this council,
yet he was unable, in a moment of disgust, to refrain
from stigmatizing them. "About this time," he
says, "there arose a sedition between the high priests
and the principal men of the multitude of Jerusalem,
each of which assembled a company of the boldest sort
of men, and of those that loved innovations, and became
leaders to them. And when they struggled together
they did it by casting reproachful words against
one another, and by throwing stones also. And there
was nobody to reprove them; but these disorders were
done after a licentious manner in the city, as if it had
no government over it. And such was the impudence
and boldness that had seized on the high priests that
they had the hardness to send their servants into the
threshing-floors, to take away those tithes that were due
the [simple] priests. Insomuch that the poorest priests
died of want."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Such are the acts, the spirit of equity
and kindness, that characterized the chief judges of
Christ! But the Talmud goes farther still. This
book, which ordinarily is not sparing of eulogies on the
people of our nation, yet, considering separately and by
name, as we have done, the high priests of that time,
it exclaims: "What a plague is the family of Simon
Boethus; cursed be their lances! What a plague is
the family of Ananos; cursed be their hissing of vipers!
What a plague is the family of Cantharus; cursed be
their pens! What a plague is the family of Ismael ben
Phabi; cursed be their fists! They are high priests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>themselves, their sons are treasurers, their sons-in-law
are commanders, and their servants strike the people
with staves."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The Talmud continues: "The porch
of the sanctuary cried out four times. The first time,
Depart from here, descendants of Eli;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> ye pollute the
Temple of the Eternal! The second time, Let Issachar
ben Keifar Barchi depart from here, who polluteth
himself and profaneth the victims consecrated to God!<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
The third time, Widen yourselves, ye gates of the sanctuary,
and let Israel ben Phabi the willful enter, that
he may discharge the functions of the priesthood! Yet
another cry was heard, Widen yourselves, ye gates, and
let Ananias ben Nebedeus the gourmand enter, that he
may glut himself on the victims!" In the face of such
low morality, avowed by the least to be suspected of
our own nation, is it possible to restrain one's indignation
against those who sat at the trial of Christ as members
of the chamber of priests? This indignation becomes
yet more intense when one remembers that an
ambitious hypocrisy, having for its aim the domineering
over the people, had perverted the law of Moses
in these men. The majority of the priests belonged,
in fact, to the Pharisaic order, the members of which
sect made religion subservient to their personal ambition;
and in order to rule over the people with more
ease, they used religion as a tool to effect this purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>encumbering the law of Moses with exaggerated precepts
and insupportable burdens which they strenuously
imposed upon others, but failed to observe themselves.
Can we, then, be astonished at the murderous
hatred which these false and ambitious men conceived
for Christ? When his words, sharper than a sword,
exposed their hypocrisy and displayed the corrupt interior
of these whitened sepulchers wearing the semblance
of justice, the hatred they already cherished for
him grew to a frenzied intensity. They never forgave
him for having publicly unmasked them. Hypocrisy
never forgives that.</p>

<p>Such were the men composing the council of priests,
when the Sanhedrin assembled to judge Christ. Were
we not justified in forming of them an unfavorable
opinion?... But let us pass on to the second chamber,
viz., the chamber of the scribes.</p>

<h5>II. <span class="smcap">Chamber of the Scribes</span></h5>

<p>Let us recall in a few words who the scribes were.
Chosen indiscriminately among the Levites and laity,
they formed the <i>corps savant</i> of the nation; they were
doctors in Israel, and were held in high esteem and
veneration. It is well known what respect the Jews,
and the Eastern nations generally, have always had
for their <i>wise men</i>.</p>

<p>Next to the chamber of the priests, that of the scribes
was the most important. But from information gathered
from the documents to which we have already
referred, we are constrained to affirm that, with a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
individual exceptions, this chamber was no better than
that of the priests.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the names and histories of
the <i>wise men</i> who composed the chamber of the scribes
at the trial of Christ:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gamaliel</span>, surnamed the ancient. He was a very
worthy Israelite, and his name is spoken of with honor
in the Talmud as well as in the Acts of the Apostles.
He belonged to a noble family, being a grandson of
the famous Hillel, who, coming from Babylon forty
years before Christ, taught with such brilliant success
in Jerusalem. Gamaliel acquired so great a reputation
among his people for his scientific acquirements that
the Talmud could say of him: "<i>With the death of
Rabbi Gamaliel the glory of the law has departed.</i>"
It was at the feet of this doctor that Saul, afterwards
Paul the apostle, studied the law and Jewish traditions,
and we know how he gloried in this fact. Gamaliel
had also among his disciples Barnabas and Stephen,
the first martyr for the cause of Christ. When the
members of the Sanhedrin discussed the expediency of
putting the apostles to death, this worthy Israelite prevented
the passing of the sentence by pronouncing these
celebrated words: "Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
what ye intend to do as touching these men....
And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, and
let them alone; for if this counsel be of men it will
come to naught; but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow
it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against
God." Gamaliel died nineteen years after Christ (52
<span class="small">A.D.</span>). (Acts v. 34-39; xxii. 3; Mishna, "Sotah," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>

Juchasin," or "the Book of the Ancestors," p. 53;
David Ganz, "Germe de David ou Chronologie" to
4768; Bartolocci, "Bibliotheca magna Rabbinica," T.
i. pp. 727-732.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>, son of Gamaliel, like his father, had a seat
in the assembly. The rabbinical books speak of him
in the highest terms of eulogy. The Mishna, for instance,
attributes to him this sentence: "Brought up
from my infancy among learned men, I have found
nothing that is of greater value to man than silence.
Doctrines are not the chief things, but work. He who
is in the habit of much talking falls easily into error."
This Simon became afterwards the intimate friend of
the too celebrated bandit, John of Giscala, whose excesses
and cruelty toward the Romans, and even the
Jews, caused Titus to order the pillaging of Jerusalem.
Simon was killed in the last assault in 70 <span class="small">A.D.</span> (David
Ganz, "Chronologie" to 4810; Mishna, "Aboth," or
"of the Fathers," C. I.; "Talmud," Jerusalem, "Berachoth,"
or "of Blessings," fol. 6, verso; "Historia
Docorium Misnicorum," J. H. Otthonis, pp. 110-113;
De Champagny, "Rome et la Judée," T. ii.
86-171.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Onkelos</span> was born of heathen parents, but embraced
Judaism, and became one of the most eminent disciples
of Gamaliel. He is the author of the famous Chaldaic
paraphrase of the Pentateuch. Although the rabbinical
books do not mention him as a member of the
Sanhedrin, yet it is highly probable that he belonged
to that body, his writings and memory having always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
been held in great esteem by the Jews; even at the
present day every Jew is enjoined to read weekly a
portion of his version of the books of Moses. Onkelos
carried the Pharisaical intolerance to the last degree.
Converted from idolatry to Judaism, he hated the Gentiles
to such an extent that he cast into the Dead Sea,
as an object of impurity, the sum of money that he
had inherited from his parents. We can easily understand
how that, with such a disposition, he would not
be favorably inclined toward Jesus, who received Gentiles
and Jews alike. ("Talmud," "Megilla," or "Festival
of Esther," fol. 3, verso; "Baba-bathra," or "the
Last Gate," fol. 134, verso; "Succa," or "the Festival
of Tabernacles," fol. 28, verso; "Thosephthoth," or
"Supplements to the Mishna," C. v.; Rabbi Gedalia,
"Tzaltzeleth Hakkabalah," or "the Chain of the Kabalah,"
p. 28; "Histor. Doct. Misnic.," p. 110; De
Rossi, "Dizionario degli Autori Ebrei," p. 81.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonathan</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Uziel</span>, author of a very remarkable
paraphrase of the Pentateuch and the Prophets. There
is a difference of opinion regarding the precise time
at which he lived. Some place it several years before
Christ; others at the time of Christ. We believe, however,
that not only was he contemporary with Christ,
but that he was also one of his judges. In support of
our assertion we give the two following proofs, which
we think indisputable: 1. Jonathan, the translator of
the Prophets, has purposely omitted Daniel, which
omission the Talmud explains as due to the special
intervention of an angel who informed him that the
manner in which the prophet speaks of the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
the Messiah coincided too exactly with that of Jesus
of Nazareth. Now, since Jonathan has intentionally
left out the prophecies of Daniel on account of their
coincidence with the death of Christ, it proves that he
could not have lived before Christ, but must have been
contemporary with him. 2. In comparing the paraphrase
of Onkelos with that of Jonathan, we find that
the latter had made use of the work of the former,
who lived in the time of Christ. Examples may be
found in Deut. xxii. 5, Judges v. 26, Num. xxi. 28, 29.
If, then, Jonathan utilized the work of Onkelos, who
lived in the time of Christ, the fact proves beyond question
that he could not have lived before Christ. The
Talmudists, in order to reward this person for having,
through his hatred of Christ, erased the name of Daniel
from the roll of prophets, eulogize him in the most
absurd manner. They relate that while engaged in the
study of the law of God, the atmosphere which surrounded
him, and came in contact with the light of his
understanding, so caught fire from his fervor that the
birds, silly enough to be attracted toward it, were consumed
immediately. ("Talmud," "Succa," or "the
Festival of Tabernacles," fol. 28, verso; David Ganz,
"Chronol." 4728; Gesenius, "Comm. on Isaiah," Part
I. p. 65; Zunz, "Culte divin des Juifs," Berlin, 1832,
p. 61; Dérembourg, work quoted above, p. 276; Hanneburg,
"Révelat Bibliq.," ii. 163, 432.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Hakaton</span>, or <i>the Less</i>. Surnamed to distinguish
him from Samuel the prophet. It was he who,
some time after the resurrection of Christ, composed
the famous imprecation against the Christians, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
"Birchath Hamminim" (Benedictions of Infidels).
The "Birchath Hamminim," says the Talmud, and
the commentary of R. Jarchi, "was composed by R.
Samuel Hakaton at Jabneh, where the Sanhedrin had
removed after the misconduct of the Nazarene, who
taught a doctrine contrary to the words of the living
God." The following is the singular benediction:
"<i>Let there be no hope for the apostates of religion,
and let all heretics, whosoever they may be, perish
suddenly. May the kingdom of pride be rooted out;
let it be annihilated quickly, even in our days! Be
blessed, O Lord, who destroyest the impious, and humblest
the proud!</i>" As soon as Samuel Hakaton had
composed this malediction, it was inserted as an additional
blessing in the celebrated prayer of the synagogue,
the "Shemonah-Essara" (the eighteen blessings).
These blessings belonged to the time of Ezra&mdash;that
is to say, five centuries before the Christian era;
and every Jew has to recite it daily. St. Jerome was
not ignorant of this strange prayer. He says: "<i>The
Jews anathematize three times daily in their synagogue
the name of the Christian, disguising it under the name
of Nazarene.</i>" According to R. Gedalia, Samuel died
before the destruction of Jerusalem, about fifteen or
twenty years after Christ. ("Talmud," "Berachoth,"
or "of Prayers," fol. 28, verso; "Megilla," or "the
Festival of Esther," fol. 28, verso; St. Jerome, "Comment.
on Isaiam," B. II. C. V. 18, 19; Tom. iv. p. 81
of the "Valarsius," quarto edition; Vitringa, "de Synagoga
vetr.," T. ii. p. 1036, 1047, 1051; Castellus, "Lexicon
heptaglotton," art. Min.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanania</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Chiskia</span>. He was a great conciliator
in the midst of the doctrinal quarrels so common
at that time; and it happened that the rival schools
of Shammai and Hillel, which were not abolished with
the death of their founders, often employed him as
their arbitrator. This skillful umpire did not always
succeed, however, in calming the disputants; for we
read in the ancient books that in the transition from
force of argument to argument of force, the members
of the schools of Shammai and Hillel frequently
came to blows. Hence the French expression <i>se chammailler</i>.
It happened, however, according to the Talmud,
that Chanania once departed from his usual system
of equilibrium in favor of the prophet Ezekiel.
It appears that on one occasion the most influential
members of the Sanhedrin proposed to censure, and
even reject, the book of this prophet, because, according
to their opinion, it contained several passages in
contradiction of the law of Moses; but Chanania defended
it with so much eloquence that they were
obliged to desist from their project. This fact alone,
reported fully as it is in the Talmud, would be sufficient
to show the laxity of the study of the prophecies
at that time. Although the exact date of his death is
uncertain, it is, nevertheless, sure that it took place
before the destruction of the Temple. ("Talmud,"
"Chagiga," or "the obligations of the males to present
themselves three times a year at Jerusalem," 2, 13;
"Shabbath," or "of the Sabbath," C. I.; "Sepher Juchasin,"
or "the Book of Ancestors," p. 57.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ismael</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Eliza</span>, renowned for the depth of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
mind and the beauty of his face. The rabbins record
that he was learned in the most mysterious things; for
example, he could command the angels to descend from
heaven and ascend thither. We have it also from the
same authority that his mother held him in such high
admiration that one day on his return from school she
washed his feet, and, through respect for him, drank
the water she had used for that purpose. His death
was of a no less romantic nature. It appears that after
the capture of Jerusalem, the daughter of Titus was
so struck with his beauty that she obtained permission
of her father to have the skin of his face taken off after
his death, which skin she had embalmed, and, having
perfumed it, she sent it to Rome to figure among the
spoils as a trophy. ("Talmud," "Aboda Zarah," or
"of Idolatry," C. I.; Rabbi Gedalia, "Tzaltzeleth
Hakkabalah," or "the Chain of the Kabalah," p. 29;
"Sepher Juchasin," or "the Book of Ancestors," p. 25;
"Tosephoth Kiddushin," C. IV.)</p>

<p>Rabbi <span class="smcap">Zadok</span>. He was about forty years old at the
trial of Christ, and died after the burning of the Temple,
aged over seventy. The Talmud relates that for
forty years he ceased not from fasting, that God might
so order it that the Temple should not be destroyed by
fire. Upon this the question is propounded in the same
book, but no answer given, as to how this rabbin could
have known that the Temple was threatened with so
great a calamity. We believe that Rabbi Zadok could
have obtained information of this terrible event in one
of the two ways&mdash;either from the prophetic voice of
Daniel which proclaimed more than forty years previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
to the occurrence that abomination and desolation
should crush the Temple of Jerusalem when the
Messiah should have been put to death; or by the
voice of Jesus himself, who said forty years before the
destruction of the Temple: "See ye not all these
things?" (i.e., the buildings of the Temple) "verily,
verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here
one stone upon another that shall not be thrown
down." (Mishna, "Shabbath," or "of the Sabbath,"
C. XXIV. 5 to end; "Eduth," or "of Testimony,"
C. VII. 1; "Aboth," or "of the Fathers of Tradition,"
IV. 5; David Ganz, "Chronol." 4785; Seph.
Juchasin," fol. 21, 26; Schikardi, "Jus Regium Hebræorum,"
p. 468; Dan. ix. 25-27; Luke xxi. 6; Matt.
xxvi. 2.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jochanan</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Zakai</span>. The rabbinical books accord
to this rabbi an extraordinary longevity. From their
writings it would appear that, like Moses, he lived a
hundred and twenty years, forty years of which he consecrated
to manual labor; another forty to the study
of the law; and the last forty years of his life he devoted
to imparting his knowledge to others. His reputation
as a savant was so well established that he was
surnamed the <i>Splendor of Wisdom</i>. After the destruction
of the Temple, he rallied together the remaining
members of the Sanhedrin to Jabneh, where he presided
over this remnant for the last four or five years
of his life. He died in the year 73 <span class="small">A.D.</span> When he
breathed his last, says the Mishna, a cry of anguish
was heard, saying: "With the death of Jochanan ben
Zakai the splendor of wisdom has been quenched!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
We have, however, other information regarding this
rabbi which is, so to speak, like the reverse side of a
medal. The Bereshith Rabba says that Rabbi Jochanan
was in the habit of eulogizing himself in the most
extravagant manner, and gives the following as a specimen
of the praises he bestowed upon himself: "If the
skies were parchment, all the inhabitants of the world
writers, and all the trees of the forest pens, all these
would not suffice to transcribe the doctrines which he
had learned from the masters." What humility of language!
One day his disciples asked him to what he
attributed his long life. "To my wisdom and piety,"
was his reply in his tone of habitual modesty. Besides,
if we were to judge of his moral character by an ordinance
of which he is the author, his morality might
be equal to the standard of his humility. He abolished
the Mosaical command of the ordeal of bitter waters,
immorally isolating a passage in Isaiah from its context.
Finally, to fill up the measure of his honesty, he
became one of the lewdest courtiers of Titus, and the
destroyer of his country. But while obsequious to human
grandeur, he was obdurate to the warnings of God,
and died proud and impenitent. ("Talmud," "Rosh
Hashanah," or "of the New Year," fol. 20, recto;

14; Jos., "Wars," VI. V. 3; De Champagny, "Rome
et la Judée," T. i. p. 158.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abba Saul.</span> He was of prodigious height, and had
the charge of superintending the burials of the dead,
that everything might be done according to the law.
The rabbins, who delight in the marvelous, affirm that
in the exercise of his duties he found the thigh bone
of Og, the King of Bashan, and the right eye of Absalom.
By virtue of the marrow extracted from the thigh
of Og, he was enabled to chase a young buck for three
leagues; as for the eye of Absalom, it was so deep
that he could have hidden himself in it as if in a cavern.
These stories, no doubt, appear very puerile; and
yet, according to a Talmudical book (Menorath-Hammoer,
"the lighted candlestick"), which is considered
of great authority even in the modern [orthodox] synagogue,
we must judge of these matters in the following
manner: "Everything which our doctors have taught
in the Medrashim (allegoric or historical commentaries)
we are bound to consider and believe in as the
law of Moses our master; and if we find anything in
it which appears exaggerated and incredible, we must
attribute it to the weakness of our understandings,
rather than to their teachings; and whoever turns into
ridicule whatever they have said will be punished."
According to Maimonides, Abba Saul died before the
destruction of the Temple. (Mishna, "Middoth," or
"of the Dimensions of the Temple," Chapter, "Har
habbaith"; "Talmud," "Nidda," or "the Purification
of Women," C. III. fol. 24, recto; Maimonides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
"Proef ad zeraim"; Drach, "Harmonies entre l'Eglise
et la Synagogue," T. ii. p. 375.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. Chanania</span>, surnamed the Vicar of the Priests.
The Mishna attributes to him a saying which brings
clearly before us the social position of the Jewish people
in the last days of Jerusalem. "Pray," said he,
"for the Roman Empire; for should the terror of its
power disappear in Palestine, neighbor will devour
neighbor alive." This avowal shows the deplorable
state of Judea, and the divisions to which she had become
a prey. The Romans seem, however, to have
cared very little for the sympathy of R. Chanania, for,
having possessed themselves of the city, they put him
to death. (Mishna, "Aboth," or "of the Fathers of
Tradition," C. III. 2; "Zevachim," or "of Sacrifices,"
C. IX. 3; "Eduth," or "of Testimony," C. II. 1;
David Ganz, "Chronologie," 4826; "Sepher Juchasin,"
or "the Book of Ancestors," p. 57.)</p>

<p>Rabbi <span class="smcap">Eleazar</span> <i>ben</i> <span class="smcap">Partah</span>, one of the most esteemed
scribes of the Sanhedrin, on account of his
scientific knowledge. Already very aged at the destruction
of the Temple, he yet lived several years after
that national calamity. ("Talmud," "Gittin," or "of
Divorces," C. III. 4; "Sepher Juchasin," p. 31.)</p>

<p>Rabbi <span class="smcap">Nachum Halbalar</span>. He is mentioned in
the rabbinical books as belonging to the Sanhedrin
in the year 28 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, but nothing particular is mentioned
of his history. ("Talmud," "Peah," or "of the Angle,"
C. II. 6, "Sanhedrin.")</p>

<p>Rabbi <span class="smcap">Simon Hamizpah</span>. He also is said to have
belonged to the Sanhedrin in the year 28 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
this but little is known. ("Talmud," "Peah," C.
II. 6.)</p>

<p>These are, according to Jewish tradition, the principal
scribes, or doctors, that composed the second chamber
of the Sanhedrin at the time of the trial of Christ.
The ancient books which speak of them are, of course,
filled with their praises. Nevertheless, blended with
these praises are some remarks which point to the predominant
vice of these men&mdash;namely, pride. We read
in Rabbi Nathan's book, "Aruch" (a Talmudical dictionary
of great authority<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>): "<i>In the past and more
honorable times the titles of rabbin, rabbi, or rav,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> to
designate the learned men of Babylon and Palestine,
were unknown; thus when Hillel came from Babylon
the title of rabbi was not added to his name. It was
the same with the prophets, who were styled simply
Isaiah, Haggai, etc., and not Rabbi Isaiah, Rabbi Haggai,
etc. Neither did Ezra bring the title of rabbi with
him from Babylon. It was not until the time of Gamaliel,
Simon, and Jochanan ben Zackai that this imposing
title was first introduced among the worthies of the
Sanhedrin.</i>"</p>

<p>This pompous appellation appears, indeed, for the
first time among the Jews contemporary with Christ.
"They love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the
chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the market-places,
and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>Proud of their titles and learning, they laid claim to
the foremost rank in society. <i>A wise man</i>, say they,
<i>should be preferred to a king; the king takes the precedence
of the high priest; the priest of the Levite; the
Levite of the ordinary Israelite. The wise man should
be preferred to the king, for if the wise man should
die he could not easily be replaced; while the king
could be succeeded by an Israelite of any order</i>.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Basing
the social status on this maxim we are not astonished
to find in the Talmud<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> that at a certain time
twenty-four persons were excommunicated for having
failed to render to the rabbi the reverence due his
position. Indeed, a very small offense was often sufficient
to call forth maledictions from this haughty and
intolerant dignitary. Punishment was mercilessly inflicted
wherever there was open violation of any one
of the following rules established by the rabbis themselves:</p>

<p>If any one opposes his rabbi, he is guilty in the same
degree as if he opposed God himself.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>If any one quarrels with his rabbi, it is as if he
contended with the living God.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>If any one thinks evil of his rabbi, it is as if he
thought evil of the Eternal.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>This self-sufficiency was carried to such an enormous
extent that when Jerusalem fell into the hands of Titus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>who came against it armed with the sword of vengeance
of Jehovah, Rabbi Jehudah wrote with an unflinching
pen: "<i>If Jerusalem was destroyed, we need
look for no other cause than the people's want of respect
for the rabbis.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>We ask now of every sincere Israelite, What opinion
can be formed of the members of the second chamber
who are about to assist in pronouncing judgment upon
Christ? Could impartiality be expected of those proud
and selfish men, whose lips delighted in nothing so
much as sounding their own praises? What apprehensions
must one not have of an unjust and cruel verdict
when he remembers it was of these very men that
Christ had said: "Beware of the scribes, which desire
to walk in long robes; they make broad their phylacteries
and enlarge the borders of their garments; they
love greetings in the market, and to be called Rabbi,
Rabbi; which devour widows' houses; and for show
make long prayers."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The remembrance of this rebuke,
so galling to their pride, continually rankled in
their minds; and when the opportunity came, with
what remorseless hate did they wreak upon him their
vengeance! We may, then, conclude from the foregoing
facts that the members of the chamber of the
scribes were no better than those composing the chamber
of the priests. To this assertion, however, there is
one exception to be made; for, as we have already
seen, there was among those arrogant and unscrupulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>men<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> one whose sense of justice was not surpassed by
his great learning. That man was Gamaliel.</p>

<h5>III. <span class="smcap">Chamber of the Elders</span></h5>

<p>This chamber was the least influential of the three;
hence, but few names of the persons composing it at
the period to which we refer have been preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph of Arimathea.</span> The Gospel makes of him
the following eulogy: Rich man; honorable counselor;
good and just man; the same had not consented to the
counsel and deed of the others. Joseph of Arimathea
is called in the Vulgate, or the Latin version of the
Bible, "noble centurion," because he was one of the
ten magistrates or senators who had the principal authority
in Jerusalem under the Romans. His noble
position is more clearly marked in the Greek version.
That he was one of the seventy may be concluded, first,
because it was common to admit senators who were
considered the ancients of the people in this assembly;
they were indeed the chiefs and the princes of the
nation&mdash;<i>seniores populi, principes nostri</i>; second, because
these words, "he had not consented to the counsel
and deed of the others," proves that he had a right to
be in the grand assembly and take part in the discussions.
(Matt. xxvii. 57-59; Mark xv. 43-46; Luke
xxiii. 50; John xix. 38; Jacobi Alting, "Schilo seu de
Vaticinio patriarchæ Jacobi," p. 310; Goschler, <i>Diction.
Encyclopediq.</i>; word, "Arimathea"; Cornelius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>Lapidus, "Comment. in Script. sac.," edition Vivés,
T. xv. p. 638, second col.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicodemus.</span> St. John the Evangelist says that he
was by profession a Pharisee, a prince of the Jews,
a master in Israel, and a member of the Sanhedrin,
where he one day attempted to oppose his colleagues
by speaking in defense of Jesus. This act brought
down upon him the disdainful retort from the others,
"Art thou also a Galilean?" He was one, it is true,
but in secret. We know from the Gospel account of
him that he possessed great riches, and that he used
nearly a hundred pounds of myrrh and spices for the
burial of Christ. The name of Nicodemus is mentioned
in the Talmud also; and, although it was known
that his attachment to Christ was great, he is, nevertheless,
spoken of with honor. But this fact may be
due to his great wealth. There were, says the Hebrew
book, three eminent men in Jerusalem&mdash;Nicodemus ben
Gurien, ben Tzitzith Hacksab, ben Kalba Shevuah&mdash;each
of whom could have supported the whole city
for ten years. (John iii. 1-10; vii. 50-52; xix. 39;
"Talmud" "Gittin," or "of Divorces," C. V. fol. 56,
verso; "Abodah Zarah," or "of Idolatry," C. II. fol.
25, verso; "Taanith," or "of the Fast Days," III. fol.
19, recto; fol. 20, verso; Midrash Rabbah on "Koheleth,"
VII. II; David Ganz, "Chron." 4757; Knappius,
"Comment. in Colloquium Christi cum Nicodemo";
Cornelius Lapidus, "Comment. in Joann."
Cap. III. <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben Kalba Shevuah.</span> After stating that he was
one of the three rich men of Jerusalem, the Talmud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
adds: "His name was given to him because whosoever
entered his house as hungry as a dog came out filled."
There is no doubt that his high financial position secured
for him one of the first places in the chamber
of the ancients. His memory, according to Ritter, is
still preserved among the Jews in Jerusalem. ("Talmud,"
"Gittin," or "of Divorces," C. V. fol. 56, verso;
David Ganz, "Chronol." 4757; Ritter, "Erdkunde,"
XVI. 478.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben Tzitzith Hacksab.</span> The effeminacy of this
third rich man is made known to us by the Talmud,
where it is stated that the border of his pallium trained
itself always on the softest carpets. Like Nicodemus
and Kalba Shevuah, he no doubt belonged to the Sanhedrin.
("Talmud," "Gittin," C. V. fol. 56, verso;
David Ganz, "Chron." 4757.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon.</span> From Josephus the historian we learn that
he was of Jewish parentage, and was highly esteemed
in Jerusalem on account of the accurate knowledge of
the law which he possessed. He had the boldness, one
day, to convoke an assembly of the people and to bring
an accusation against King Herod Agrippa, who, he
said, deserved, on account of his bad conduct, that the
entrance into the sacred portals should be forbidden
him. This took place eight or nine years after Christ&mdash;that
is to say, in the year 42 or 43 <span class="small">A.D.</span> We may
safely conclude that a man who had power enough to
convoke an assembly and sufficient reputation and
knowledge to dare accuse a king, must undoubtedly
have belonged to the council of the Sanhedrin. Besides,
his birth alone at a time when nobility of origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
constituted, as we have already said, a right to honors,
would have thrown wide open to him the doors
of the assembly. (Jos., "Ant.," XIX. VII. 4; Dérembourg,
"Essai sur l'histoire et la géographie de
la Palestine," p. 207, n. 1; Frankel, <i>Monatsschrift.</i>,
III. 440.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doras</span> was a very influential citizen of Jerusalem,
and is thus spoken of by Josephus. He was, however,
a man of cruel and immoral character, not hesitating,
for the sake of ingratiating himself with Governor
Felix, to cause the assassination of Jonathan, the
high priest who had made himself obnoxious to that
ruler by some just remonstrances respecting his administration.
Doras effected the assassination in cold blood
by means of murderers hired at the expense of Felix
(52 or 53 <span class="small">A.D.</span>). The prominence which this man for
a long time maintained in Jerusalem warrants the presumption
that he was a member of the Sanhedrin.

<p>These four personages were sent as ambassadors by
the Jews of Jerusalem to Emperor Claudius in the
year 44, when Cuspius Fadus was governor of Judea.
Claudius mentions this fact in a letter sent by him to
Cuspius Fadus, and which Josephus has preserved. It
is very probable that either they themselves or their
fathers were members of the chamber of the ancients;
for the Jews appointed as their ambassadors only such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
members of the Sanhedrin as were distinguished for
superior learning. (Jos., "Ant.," XX. I. 1, 2.)</p>

<p>The rabbinical books limit their information concerning
the members of this chamber to the names we
have just mentioned. To be guided, then, by the documents
quoted, one would suppose that although this
chamber was the least important of the three, yet its
members were perhaps more just than those composing
the other two, and consequently manifested less vehemence
against Christ during His trial. But a statement
made by Josephus the historian proves beyond doubt
that this third chamber was made up of men no better
than were to be found in the others. It was from
among the wealthy element of Jewish society, says Josephus,
that Sadduceeism received most of its disciples.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Since, then, the chamber of ancients was composed
principally of the rich men of Jerusalem, we may safely
conclude that the majority of its members were infected
with the errors of Sadduceeism&mdash;that is to say, with
a creed that taught that the soul dies before the body.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
We are, then, in the presence of real materialists, who
consider the destiny of man to consist in the enjoyment
of material and worldly things,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and who are so carnally
minded that it would seem as if the prophetic
indignation of David had stigmatized them beforehand
when he says: "They have so debased themselves as
to become like the beasts that have no understanding."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Let not our readers imagine that in thus speaking we
at all mean to do injustice to the memory of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>men. A fact of great importance proves indisputably
that Sadducees or Epicureans were numerous among
the Sanhedrin. When, several years after the trial
of Christ, the apostle Paul had in his turn to appear
before that body, he succeeded by the skill of his oratory
in turning the doctrinal differences of that assembly
to his benefit. "Men and brethren," he exclaimed,
"I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; of the hope
and the resurrection of the dead I am called in question."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Hardly had the apostle pronounced these
words when a hot discussion arose between the Sadducees
and the Pharisees, all of them rising and speaking
in great confusion&mdash;some for the resurrection, others
against it&mdash;and it was in the tumult of recrimination
and general uproar that the apostle was able peacefully
to withdraw. Such was the state of things in the supreme
council of the Hebrews; and men of notorious
heresy, and even impiety, were appointed as judges
to decide on questions of doctrine. Among these materialists
there were, however, two just men; and, like
Lot among the wicked inhabitants of Sodom, there
were in this assembly Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea.</p>

<p>We shall now briefly sum up the contents of the preceding
chapter. We possess certain information respecting
more than one half of the seventy-one members
of the Sanhedrin. We know almost all the high
priests, who, as we have already said, formed the principal
element of this council. This majority, as we
have intimated, is sufficient for the forming of an estimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>of the moral tone of all the judges; and before
the debates begin, it is easy to foresee the issue of the
trial of Christ.</p>

<p>What, indeed, could have been the issue of a trial
before the first chamber, composed as it was of demoralized,
ambitious, and scheming priests? of priests who
were mostly Pharisees&mdash;that is to say, men of narrow
minds, careful only of the external, haughty, overbearing,
and self-satisfied, believing themselves to be both
infallible and impeccable?<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> It is true they expected
a Messiah; but their Messiah was to subdue unto them
all their enemies, impose for their benefit a tax on all
the nations of the earth, and uphold them in all the
absurdities with which they have loaded the law of
Moses.</p>

<p>But this man who is about to be brought before them
has exposed their hypocritical semblance of piety, and
justly stripped them of the undeserved esteem in which
they were held by the people. He has absolutely denounced
the precepts which they invented and placed
above the law. He even desired to abolish the illegal
taxes which they had imposed upon the people. Are
not all these more than sufficient to condemn Him in
their eyes and prove Him worthy of death?</p>

<p>Can a more favorable verdict be expected of the
members of the second chamber, composed as it was
of men so conceited and arrogant? These doctors expected
a Messiah who would be another Solomon, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>whose reign and with whose aid they would establish
at Jerusalem an academy of learning that would
attract all the kings, even as the Queen of Sheba was
attracted to the court of the wisest king of Israel. But
this Jesus, who claims to be the Messiah, has the boldness
to declare blessed those who are humble in spirit.
His disciples are but ignorant fishermen, chosen from
the least of the tribes; his speech of a provoking simplicity,
condemning before the multitude the haughty
and pretentious language of the doctors. Are not these
things sufficient to bring down upon him their condemnation?</p>

<p>And what justice can we expect, in fine, from the
third chamber, when we remember that most of its
members were depraved Sadducees, caring only for the
enjoyment of the things of this world, heedless of the
welfare of the soul, almost denying the existence of
God, and disbelieving in the resurrection of the dead?
According to their views, the mission of the Messiah
was not to consist in the regenerating of Israel as well
as of the whole human race, but in the making of
Jerusalem the center of riches and worldly goods,
which would be brought hither by the conquered and
humbled Gentiles, who were to become the slaves of
the Israelites. But the man upon whom they are called
to pass judgment, far from attaching great importance
to wealth and dignity, as did they, prescribes to his
disciples the renunciation of riches and honors. He
even despises those things which the Sadducees esteem
most&mdash;viz., pedigree, silk attire, cups of gold, and
sumptuous repast. What could have rendered his condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
surer than such manifestations of contempt
for the pride and voluptuousness of these men?</p>

<p>To limit our inquiry to the moral characters of the
judges alone, the issue of the trial can be but fatal to
the accused; and so, when the three chambers constituting
the Sanhedrin council had entered into session,
we can well imagine that there was no hope for the
acquittal of Jesus; for are not all the high priests, as
well as the majority of the scribes and ancients, against
him?<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<h3>ACTS OF PILATE</h3>

<p>
<img src="images/letter_t-append2.jpg" width="100" height="112" alt="T" title="T"
class="floatl" />

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE apocryphal Acts of Pilate
are herewith given under Appendix II.
The authenticity of
these writings has never been
finally settled by the scholarship
of the world. It is safe to
say, however, that the current
of modern criticism is decidedly
against their genuineness. Nevertheless,
the following facts seem to be very generally
conceded by the critics: That there are now in existence
certain ancient documents called the "Acts of
Pilate"; that they were probably discovered at Turin,
in northern Italy, and were first used by the
noted New Testament palæographer, Dr. Constantine
Tischendorf, who studied them in company with the
celebrated orientalist, Victor Amadee Peyron, professor
of oriental languages in the University of Turin;
and, furthermore, that these documents that we now
have are approximately accurate copies of the document
mentioned by Justin Martyr about the year 138
<span class="small">A.D.</span>, and by Tertullian about the year 200 <span class="small">A.D.</span></p>

<p>But, admitting all these things, the question of <i>genuineness</i>
and <i>authenticity</i> still remains to be settled. Was
the document referred to by Justin as the "Acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Pilate," and again as the "Acts recorded under Pontius
Pilate," a genuine manuscript, written by or composed
under the direction of Pilate, or was it a "pious
fraud of some Christian," who gathered his prophecies
from the Old, and his facts from the New Testament,
and then embellished both with his imagination?</p>

<p>The subject is too vast and the space at our disposal
is too limited to permit a discussion of the authenticity
of the Acts of Pilate. We have deemed it sufficient
to insert under Appendix II lengthy extracts from the
writings of Tischendorf and Lardner, two of the most
celebrated biblical critics, relating to the genuineness
of these Acts. The reader would do well to peruse
these extracts carefully before reading the Acts of
Pilate.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lardner's Remarks on the Acts of Pilate</span></h4>

<p class="center"><i>The Acts of Pontius Pilate, and his letter to Tiberius</i></p>

<p>"Justin Martyr, in his first Apology, which was
presented to the emperor Antoninus Pius, and the
Senate of Rome, about the year 140, having mentioned
our Savior's crucifixion and some of the circumstances
of it, adds: 'And that these things were so done you
may know from the Acts made in the time of Pontius
Pilate.'</p>

<p>"Afterwards in the same Apology, having mentioned
some of our Lord's miracles, such as healing diseases
and raising the dead, he adds: 'And that these things
were done by him you may know from the Acts made
in the time of Pontius Pilate.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>

<p>"Tertullian, in his Apology, about the year 200,
having spoken of our Savior's crucifixion and resurrection,
and his appearance to his disciples, who were
ordained by him to preach the gospel over the world,
goes on: 'Of all these things, relating to Christ, Pilate,
in his conscience a Christian, sent an account to Tiberius,
then emperor.'</p>

<p>"In another chapter or section of his Apology,
nearer the beginning, he speaks to this purpose: 'There
was an ancient decree that no one should be received
for a deity unless he was first approved by the senate.
Tiberius, in whose time the Christian religion had its
rise, having received from Palestine in Syria an account
of such things as manifested our Savior's divinity, proposed
to the senate, and giving his own vote as first in
his favor, that he should be placed among the gods.
The senate refused, because he himself had declined
that honor.'</p>

<p>"'Nevertheless the emperor persisted in his own
opinion, and ordered that if any accused the Christians
they should be punished.' And then adds: 'Search,'
says he, 'your own writings, and you will there find
that Nero was the first emperor who exercised any acts
of severity toward the Christians, because they were
then very numerous at Rome.'</p>

<p>"It is fit that we should now observe what notice
Eusebius takes of these things in his Ecclesiastical History.
It is to this effect: 'When the wonderful resurrection
of our Savior, and his ascension to heaven, were
in the mouths of all men, it being an ancient custom
for the governors of provinces to write the emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
and give him an account of new and remarkable occurrences,
that he might not be ignorant of anything;
our Savior's resurrection being much talked of throughout
all of Palestine, Pilate informed the emperor of it,
as likewise of his miracles, which he had heard of, and
that being raised up after he had been put to death,
he was already believed by many to be a god. And
it is said that Tiberius referred the matter to the senate,
but that they refused their consent, under a pretence
that it had not been first approved of by them;
there being an ancient law that no one should be deified
among the Romans without an order of the senate;
but, indeed, because the saving and divine doctrine of
the gospel needed not to be confirmed by human judgment
and authority. However, Tiberius persisted in
his former sentiment, and allowed not anything to be
done that was prejudicial to the doctrine of Christ.
These things are related by Tertullian, a man famous
on other accounts, and particularly for his skill in the
Roman laws. I say he speaks thus in his Apology for
the Christians, written by him in the Roman tongue,
but since (in the days of Eusebius) translated into the
Greek.' His words are these: 'There was an ancient
decree that no one should be consecrated as a deity by
the emperor, unless he was first approved of by the
senate. Marcus Aemilius knows this by his god Alburnus.
This is to our purpose, forasmuch as among
you divinity is bestowed by human judgment.'</p>

<p>"And if God does not please man, he shall not be
God. And, according to this way of thinking, man
must be propitious to God. Tiberius, therefore, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
whose time the Christian name was first known in the
world, having received an account of this doctrine out
of Palestine, where it began, communicated that account
to the senate; giving his own suffrage at the same
time in favor of it. But the senate rejected it, because
it had not been approved by themselves. 'Nevertheless
the emperor persisted in his judgment, and threatened
death to such as should accuse the Christians.'
'Which,' adds Eusebius, 'could not be other than the
disposal of Divine Providence, that the doctrine of
the gospel, which was then in its beginning, might be
preached all over the world without molestation.' So
Eusebius.</p>

<p>"Divers exceptions have been made by learned moderns
to the original testimonies of Justin Martyr and
Tertullian. 'Is there any likelihood,' say they, 'that
Pilate should write such things to Tiberius concerning
a man whom he had condemned to death? And if
he had written them, is it probable that Tiberius should
propose to the senate to have a man put among the
gods upon the bare relation of a governor of a province?
And if he had proposed it, who can make a
doubt that the senate would not have immediately complied?
So that though we dare not say that this narration
is absolutely false, yet it must be reckoned as
doubtful.' So says Du Pin.</p>

<p>"These and other difficulties shall now be considered.</p>

<p>"Now, therefore, I shall mention some observations:</p>

<p>"In the first place, I shall observe that Justin Martyr
and Tertullian are early writers of good repute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
That is an observation of Bishop Pearson. These testimonies
are taken from the most public writings, Apologies
for the Christian religion, presented, or at least
proposed and recommended to the emperor and senate
of Rome, or to magistrates of high authority and great
distinction in the Roman empire.</p>

<p>Secondly: It certainly was the custom of governors
of provinces to compose Acts or memoirs or commentaries
of the remarkable occurrences in the places where
they presided.</p>

<p>In the time of the first Roman emperors there were
Acts of the Senate, Acts of the City, or People of
Rome, Acts of other cities, and Acts of governors of
provinces. Of all these we can discern clear proofs
and frequent mention in ancient writers of the best
credit. Julius Cæsar ordered that Acts of the Senate,
as well as daily Acts of the People, should be published.
See Sueton. Jul. Cæs. c. xx.</p>

<p>"Augustus forbade publishing Acts of the Senate.</p>

<p>"There was an officer, himself a senator, whose province
it was to compose those Acts.</p>

<p>"The Acts of the Senate must have been large and
voluminous, containing not only the question proposed,
or referred to the senate by the consul, or the
emperor, but also the debates and speeches of the
senators.</p>

<p>"The Acts of the People, or City, were journals or
registers of remarkable births, marriages, divorces,
deaths, proceedings in courts of judicature, and other
interesting affairs, and some other things below the
dignity of history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>"To these Acts of each kind Roman authors frequently
had recourse for information.</p>

<p>"There were such Acts or registers at other places
besides Rome, particularly at Antium. From them
Suetonius learned the day and place of the birth of
Caligula, about which were other uncertain reports.
And he speaks of those Acts as public authorities, and
therefore more decisive and satisfactory than some
other accounts.</p>

<p>"There were also Acts of the governors of provinces,
registering all remarkable transactions and occurrences.</p>

<p>"Justin Martyr and Tertullian could not be mistaken
about this; and the learned bishop of Cæsarea
admits the truth of what they say. And in the time
of the persecuting emperor Maximin, about the year
of Christ 307, the heathen people forged Acts of Pilate,
derogatory to the honor of our Savior, which were diligently
spread abroad, to unsettle Christians, or discourage
them in the profession of their faith. Of this we
are informed by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History.</p>

<p>Thirdly: It was customary for the governors of provinces
to send to the emperor an account of remarkable
transactions in places where they presided.</p>

<p>"So thought the learned Eusebius, as we have seen.</p>

<p>"And Pliny's letters to Trajan, still extant, are a
proof of it. Philo speaks of the Acts or Memoirs of
Alexandria sent to Caligula, which that emperor read
with more eagerness and satisfaction than anything else.</p>

<p>"Fourthly: It has been said to be very unlikely that
Pilate should write such things to Tiberius, concerning
a man whom he [Pilate] had condemned to death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>"To which it is easy to reply, that if he wrote to
Tiberius at all, it is very likely that he should speak
favorably and honorably of the Savior.</p>

<p>"That Pilate passed sentence of condemnation upon
our Lord very unwillingly, and not without a sort of
compulsion, appears from the history of the Evangelist:
Matt. xxvii.; Mark xv.; Luke xxiii.; John xviii. Pilate
was hard pressed. The rulers of the Jews vehemently
accused our Lord to him. They said they had
found him perverting the nation, and forbidding to
give tribute to Cæsar, saying that himself is Christ, a
king, and the like; and all without effect for a while.</p>

<p>"Pilate still sought for expedients to set Jesus at
liberty.</p>

<p>"As his reluctance had been very manifest and public
in a court of judicature, in the chief city of the
nation at the time of one of their great festivals, it is
highly probable that when he sent to Rome he should
make some apology for his conduct. Nor could anything
be more proper than to allege some of our Savior's
miracles which he had heard of, and to give an
account to the zeal of those who professed faith in him
after his ignominious crucifixion, and openly asserted
that he had risen from the dead and ascended to heaven.</p>

<p>"Pilate would not dare in such a report to write
falsehood, nor to conceal the most material circumstances
of the case about which he was writing. At
the trial he publicly declared his innocence: and told
the Jews several times 'that he found no fault in him
at all.'</p>

<p>"And when he was going to pronounce the sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
of condemnation, he took water and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying: I am innocent of the
blood of this just person: 'See ye to it.' Matt.
xxvii. 24.</p>

<p>"When he wrote to Tiberius he would very naturally
say something of our Lord's wonderful resurrection
and ascension, which were much talked of and
believed by many, with which he could not be possibly
unacquainted. The mention of these things would be
the best vindication of his inward persuasion, and his
repeated declarations of our Lord's innocence upon
trial notwithstanding the loud clamors and united accusations
of the Jewish people and their rulers.</p>

<p>"Pilate, as has been said several times, passed condemnation
upon Jesus very unwillingly, and not until
after long trial.</p>

<p>"When he passed sentence upon him he gave
orders that this title or inscription should be put
upon the cross: 'Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the
Jews.'</p>

<p>"When he had expired, application was made to
Pilate, by Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor,
that the body might be taken down and buried.
To which he consented; but not till assurance from the
centurion that he had been sometime dead. The next
day some of the priests and pharisees came to him, saying:
'Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while
he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure,
until the third day, lest his disciples come by night
and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
risen from the dead.' 'So the last error shall be worse
than the first.'</p>

<p>"Pilate said unto them: 'Ye have a watch; go your
way, make it sure as you can.' So they went and made
the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting a watch.</p>

<p>"Whilst they were at the sepulchre there was a 'great
earthquake,' the stone was rolled away by an Angel,
'whose countenance was like lightning, and for fear
of whom the guards did shake and become as dead
men.' Some of the guards went down into the City,
and showed unto the chief priests all the things that
were done.</p>

<p>"Nor can there be any doubt that these things came
also to the governor's ears. Pilate, therefore, was furnished
with materials of great importance relating to
this case, very proper to be sent to the emperor. And
very probably he did send them, for he could do no
otherwise.</p>

<p>"Fifthly: it is said, 'That if Pilate had sent such
things to Tiberius, it is nevertheless very unlikely that
Tiberius should propose to the senate that our Savior
might be put among the gods, because that emperor
had little or no regard for things of religion.'</p>

<p>"But it is easy to answer that such observations are
of little or no importance. Few princes are able to
preserve uniformity in the whole of their conduct, and
it is certain that Tiberius varied from himself upon
many occasions and in different parts of his life.</p>

<p>"Sixthly: it is further urged, that if Tiberius had
proposed the thing to the senate, there can be no doubt
that the senate would have immediately complied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>"But neither is this difficulty insuperable; for we
are assured by Suetonius that Tiberius let several things
be decided by the senate contrary to his own opinion,
without showing much uneasiness.</p>

<p>(It must be observed here that Dr. Lardner is very
copious in quotations from the best authorities in proof
of all his statements. The reader is referred to Vol. VI
of his great works, pages 605-620, where will be found
these quotations in foot-notes too lengthy to be transcribed
here.)</p>

<p>"Seventhly: The right interpretation of the words
of Tertullian will be of use to remove difficulties and
to confirm the truth of the account.</p>

<p>"I have translated them in this manner: 'When
Tiberius referred the matter to the senate, that our
Lord should be placed in the number of gods, the
senate refused, because he had himself declined that
honor.'</p>

<p>"The words are understood to the like purpose by
Pearson.</p>

<p>"There is another sense, which is that of the Greek
translation of Tertullian's Apology, made use of by
Eusebius: 'The senate refused because it had not itself
approved of it.' But that sense, if it be any sense
at all, is absurd, and therefore unlikely. If none beside
the senate had a right to consecrate any for the
deity, yet certainly the consul or the emperor might
<i>refer</i> such a thing to that venerable body. According
to Tertullian's account, the whole is in a fair way of
legal proceeding." [And it may be remarked here that
Tertullian, being well versed in Roman law, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
hardly have passed by a blunder here or committed one
in anything wherein he may have had to do with the
statement.]</p>

<p>"By virtue of an ancient law, no one might be reckoned
a god (at least by the Romans) without the approbation
of the senate. Tiberius having been informed
of some extraordinary things concerning Jesus,
referred it to the senate, that he also might be placed
in the number of deities. Was it possible after this
that the senate should refuse it, under a pretense that
Tiberius had bestowed divinity upon Jesus without
their consent, when he had done no such thing, and
at the very time was referring it to their judgment in
the old legal way?</p>

<p>"Le Clerc objects that the true reading in Tertullian
is not&mdash;<i>Non quia in se non probaverat</i>, but <i>quia
non ipse probaverat</i>.</p>

<p>"Be it so. The meaning is the same. <i>Ipse</i> must
intend the emperor, not the senate. The other sense
is absurd, and next to a contradiction, and therefore
not likely to be right, and at the same time it is a rude
and needless affront. The other interpretation represents
a handsome compliment, not without foundation.
For it is very true that Tiberius had himself declined
receiving divine honors.</p>

<p>"Eighthly: It has been objected that Tiberius was
unfriendly to the Jewish people, and therefore it must
be reckoned very improbable that he should be willing
to put a man who was a Jew among the gods.</p>

<p>"But there is little or no ground for this objection.
It was obviated long ago in the first part of this work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
where beside other things it is said: In the reign of
Tiberius the Jewish people were well used. They were
indeed banished out of Italy by an edict; but it was
for a misdemeanor committed by some villains of that
nation. The great hardship was that many innocent
persons suffered beside the guilty.</p>

<p>"Upon other occasions Tiberius showed the Jews all
the favor that could be desired, especially after the
death of Sejanus; and is much applauded for it by
Philo.</p>

<p>"Ninthly: Still it is urged, 'Nothing can be more
absurd than to suppose that Tiberius would receive for
a deity a man who taught the worship of one God only,
and whose religion decried all other deities as mere
fiction.'</p>

<p>"Upon which I must say, nothing can be more absurd
than this objection. Tertullian does not suppose
Tiberius to be well acquainted with the Christian religion,
our Savior's doctrine.</p>

<p>"All he says is, that, having heard of some extraordinary
things concerning him, he had a desire to put
him among the Roman deities.</p>

<p>"Tenthly: Tertullian proceeds: 'Nevertheless the
emperor persisted in his opinion, and ordered that if
any accused the Christians they should be punished.'
This was very natural. Though the senate would not
put Jesus in the number of deities, the emperor was
still of opinion that it might have been done.</p>

<p>"And he determined to provide by an edict for the
safety of those who professed a high regard for Jesus
Christ. Which edict, as Eusebius reasonably supposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
was of use for securing the free preaching of the gospel
in many places.</p>

<p>"But the authority of that edict would cease at the
emperor's demise, if not sooner. Unfortunately, it
could not be in force, or have any great effect, for a
long season.</p>

<p>"Nor need we consider the ordering such an edict
as in favor of the Christians as an incredible thing,
if we observe what Philo says, who assures us that
'Tiberius gave orders to all the governors of provinces,
to protect the Jews in the cities where they lived
in the observation of their own rights and customs;
and that they should bear hard on none of them, but
such as were unpeaceable and transgressed the laws of
the State.'</p>

<p>"Nor is it impossible that the Christians should partake
of the like civilities, they being considered as a
sect of the Jews. And it is allowed that the Roman
empire did not openly persecute the Christians, till they
became so numerous that the heathen people were apprehensive
of the total overthrow of their religion.</p>

<p>"In the eleventh place, says a learned and judicious
writer, 'It is probable that Pilate, who had no enmity
toward Christ, and accounted him a man unjustly accused
and an extraordinary person, might be moved
by the wonderful circumstances attending and following
his death, to hold him in veneration, and perhaps
to think him a hero and the son of some deity. It is
possible that he might send a narrative, such as he
thought most convenient, of these transactions to Tiberius:
but it is not at all likely that Tiberius proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
to the senate that Christ should be deified, and that
the senate rejected it, and that Tiberius continued favorably
disposed toward Christ, and that he threatened
to punish those who should molest and accuse the Christians.'
'Observe also,' says the same learned writer,
'that the Jews persecuted the apostles, and slew Stephen,
and that Saul made havoc of the church, entering
into every house, and hailing men and women, committing
them to prison, and that Pilate connived at all
this violence, and was not afraid of the resentment of
Tiberius on that account.'</p>

<p>"Admitting the truth of all these particulars just
mentioned, it does not follow that no orders were
given by Tiberius for the protection of the followers
of Jesus.</p>

<p>"For no commands of princes are obeyed by all men
everywhere. They are oftentimes transgressed.</p>

<p>"Nor was any place more likely than Judea, where
the enmity of many against the disciples of Jesus was
so great. Nor need it be supposed that Tiberius was
very intent to have this order strictly regarded. For
he was upon many occasions very indolent and dilatory;
and he was well known to be so. Moreover, the
death of Stephen was tumultuous, and not an act of the
Jewish council. And further, the influence of Pilate
in that country was not now at its full height. We
perceive from the history of our Lord's trial before
him, as recorded in the gospels, that he stood in fear
of the Jews.</p>

<p>"He was apprehensive that, if he did not gratify
them in that point, they might draw up a long list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
maladministrations for the emperor's view. His condemnation
of Jesus at the importunity of the Jews, contrary
to his own judgment and inclination, declared to
them more than once, was a point gained; and his government
must have been ever after much weakened by
so mean a condescension. And that Pilate's influence
in the province continued to decline is manifest, in that
the people of it prevailed at last to have him removed
in a very ignominious manner by Vitellius, president
of Syria.</p>

<p>"Pilate was removed from his government before the
Passover in the year of Christ 36. After which there
was no procurator or other person with the power of
life and death, in Judea, before the ascension of Herod
Agrippa, in the year 41.</p>

<p>"In that space of time the Jews would take an unusual
license, and gratify their own malicious dispositions,
beyond what they could otherwise have done,
without control.</p>

<p>"Twelfth: Some have objected that Tertullian is so
absurd as to speak of Christians in the time of Tiberius;
though it be certain that the followers of Jesus were
not known by that denomination till some time afterwards.</p>

<p>"But this is a trifling objection. Tertullian intends
no more by Christians than followers of Jesus, by whatever
name they were known or distinguished; whether
that of Nazarenes, or Galileans, or disciples.</p>

<p>"And it is undoubted, that the Christian religion
had its rise in the reign of Tiberius; though they who
professed to believe in Jesus, as risen from the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
and ascended to heaven, were not called Christians till
some time afterwards.</p>

<p>"So at the beginning of the paragraph he says,
'There was an ancient law that no god should be
consecrated by the emperor, unless it was first approved
by the senate.' Nevertheless, Tertullian was not so
ignorant as not to know that there were not any emperors
when the ancient decree was passed.</p>

<p>"His meaning is, that no one should be deified by
any man, no, not by a consul or emperor, without the
approbation of the senate.</p>

<p>"Finally: We do not suppose that Tiberius understood
the doctrine of the Savior, or that he was at all
inclined to be a Christian.</p>

<p>"Nor did Tertullian intend to say any such thing,
for immediately after the passage first cited from him,
he adds: 'But the Cæsars themselves would have believed
in Jesus Christ, if they had not been necessary
for the world, or if Christians could have been Cæsars.'</p>

<p>"Grotius appears to have rightly understood the importance
of these passages of Tertullian; whose note
upon Matthew xxiv. 2, I have transcribed below." The
reader is referred to Vol. VI. of Lardner's Works,
where he will find the notes of this learned writer, as
quoted from various ancients and moderns, in proof of
all he has brought forward in these lengthy arguments,
and which cannot be transcribed here.</p>

<p>"Admit, then, the right interpretation of Tertullian,
and it may be allowed that what he says is not incredible
or improbable. The Romans had almost
innumerable deities, and yet they frequently added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
that number and adopted new. As deifications were
very frequent, Tiberius might have indulged a thought
of placing Jesus among the established deities without
intending to derogate from the worship or honor of
those who were already received.</p>

<p>"But the senate was not in a humor to gratify him.</p>

<p>"And the reason assigned is, because the emperor
himself had declined that honor, which is so plausible
a pretense, and so fine a compliment, that we cannot
easily suppose it to be Tertullian's own invention;
which, therefore, gives credibility to his account.</p>

<p>"Eusebius, though he acknowledged the overruling
providence of God in the favorable disposition of Tiberius
toward the first followers of Jesus, by which
means the Christian religion in its infancy was propagated
over the world with less molestation, does also
say, at the beginning of the chapter quoted, 'The senate
refused their consent to the emperor's proposal, under
a pretence that they had not been first asked, there
being an ancient law, that no one should be deified
without the approbation of the senate, but, indeed,'
adds he, 'because the saving and divine doctrine of
the gospel needed not to be ratified by human judgment
and authority.'</p>

<p>Chrysostom's observation is to like purpose, but with
some inaccuracies. It is likely that he was not at all
acquainted with Tertullian; and he was no admirer of
Eusebius. Perhaps he builds upon general tradition
only. 'The Roman senate,' says he, 'had the power of
nominating and decreeing who should be gods. When,
therefore, all things concerning Christ had been published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
he who was the governor of the Jewish nation
sent to them to know if they would be pleased to appoint
him also to be a god. But they refused, being
offended and provoked, that before their decree and
judgment had been obtained, the power of the crucified
one had shined out and had attracted all the world to
the worship of him. But, by the overruling providence
of God, this was brought to pass against their will,
that the divinity of Christ might not be established by
human appointment and that he might not be reckoned
one of the many who were deified by them.'</p>

<p>"Some of which, as he proceeds to show, had been
of infamous characters.</p>

<p>"I shall now transcribe below in his own words what
Orosius, in the fifth century, says of this matter, that
all my readers may have it at once before them without
looking farther for it." This quotation from Orosius
will be found in the "Testimony of the Fathers," under
the title, "Testimony of Orosius."</p>

<p>"And I refer to Zonoras and Nicephoras. The former
only quotes Eusebius, and transcribes into his Annals
the chapter of his Ecclesiastical History quoted
by me. Nor has Nicephoras done much more."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tischendorf's Comments on the Acts Of
Pilate</span></h4>

<p>"It is the same with the second apocryphal work
brought under review above, the so-called Acts of Pilate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
only with the difference that they refer as much
to John as to the synoptical Gospels. Justin, in like
manner as before, is the most ancient voucher for this
work, which is said to have been written under Pilate's
jurisdiction, and by reason of its specification of wonderful
occurrences before, during, and after the crucifixion,
to have borne strong evidence to the divinity
of Christ. Justin saw as little reason as Tertullian and
others for believing that it was a work of pious deception
from a Christian hand." [As has been alleged by
opponents.] "On the contrary, Justin appeals to it
twice in his first Apology in order to confirm the accounts
of the occurrences which took place at the crucifixion
in accordance with prophecy, and of the miraculous
healings effected by Christ, also the subject of
prophetic announcement. He cites specifically (chap.
35) from Isaiah lxv. 2, and lviii. 2: 'I have spread
out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people
which walketh in a way that was not good. They ask
of me the ordinances of justice, they take delight in
approaching to God.' Further, from the 22nd Psalm:
'They pierced my hands and my feet; they parted my
garments upon them and cast lots upon my vesture.'
With reference to this he remarks that Christ fulfilled
this; that he did stretch forth his hands when the Jews
crucified him&mdash;the men who contended against him
and denied that he was Christ. 'Then,' he says further,
'as the prophet foretold, they dragged him to the judgment
seat, set him upon it and said, Judge us.' The
expression, however, 'they pierced,' etc., refers to the
nails with which they fastened his feet and hands to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
cross. And after they had crucified him they threw
lots for his clothing, and they who had taken part in
the act of crucifixion divided it among themselves. To
this he adds: And you can learn from the Acts, composed
during the governorship of Pontius Pilate, that
these things really happened.</p>

<p>"Still more explicit is the testimony of Tertullian.
It may be found in Apologeticus (chap. 2) where he
says that out of envy Jesus was surrendered to Pilate
by the Jewish ceremonial lawyers, and by him, after he
had yielded to the cries of the people, given over for
crucifixion; that while hanging on the cross he gave
up the ghost with a loud cry, and so anticipated the
executioner's duty; that at that same hour the day was
interrupted by a sudden darkness; that a guard of soldiers
was set at the grave for the purpose of preventing
his disciples stealing his body, since he had predicted
his resurrection, but that on the third day the ground
was suddenly shaken and the stone rolled away from
before the sepulchre; that in the grave nothing was
found but the articles used in his burial; that the report
was spread abroad by those who stood outside that
the disciples had taken the body away; that Jesus spent
forty days with them in Galilee, teaching them what
their mission should be, and that after giving them their
instructions as to what they should preach, he was
raised in a cloud to heaven. Tertullian closes this
account with the words, 'All this was reported to the
Emperor at that time, Tiberius, by Pilate, his conscience
having compelled even him to become a Christian.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<p>"The document now in our possession corresponds
with this evidence of Justin and Tertullian. Even in
the title it agrees with the account of Justin, although
instead of the word <i>acta</i>, which he used, and which is
manifestly much more Latin than Greek, a Greek expression
is employed which can be shown to have been
used to indicate genuine Acts. The details recounted
by Justin and Tertullian are all found in our text of
the Acts of Pilate, with this variation, that nothing
corresponds to what is joined to the declaration of the
prophet, 'They dragged him to the seat of judgment
and set him upon it and said,' etc. Besides this, the
casting lots for the vesture is expressed simply by the
allusion to the division of the clothes. We must give
even closer scrutiny to one point. Justin alludes to
the miracles which were performed in fulfillment of
Old Testament prophecy, on the lame, the dumb, the
blind, the dead, and on lepers. In fact, in our Acts of
Pilate there are made to appear before the Roman governor
a palsied man who had suffered for thirty-eight
years, and was brought in a bed by young men, and
healed on the Sabbath day; a blind man cured by the
laying on of hands; a cripple who had been restored;
a leper who had been cleansed; the woman whose issue
of blood had been stanched, and a witness of the raising
of Lazarus from the dead. Of that which Tertullian
cites we will adduce merely the passage found in no
one of our gospels, that Jesus passed forty days after
his resurrection in company with his disciples in
Galilee.</p>

<p>"This is indicated in our Acts of Pilate at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
of the fifteenth chapter, where the risen man is represented
as saying to Joseph: 'For forty days go not out
of thy house, for behold I go to my brethren in Galilee.'</p>

<p>"Every one will perceive how strongly the argument
that our Acts of Pilate are the same which Justin and
Tertullian read is buttressed by these unexpected coincidences.
The assertion recently made requires, consequently,
no labored contradiction that the allusions to
both men have grown out of their mere suspicion that
there was such a record as the Acts of Pilate, or out
of the circulation of a mere story about such a record,
while the real work was written as the consequence of
these allusions at the close of the third century. What
an uncommon fancy it requires in the two men to coincide
so perfectly in a single production, as is the case
in the Acts to which I am now referring. And are
we to imagine that they referred with such emphasis
as they employed to the mere creations of their fancy?</p>

<p>"The question has been raised with more justice,
whether the production in our possession may not have
been a copy or a free revision of the old and primitive
one. The modern change in the title has given support
to this conjecture, for it has occasioned the work
to be commonly spoken of as the Gospel of Nicodemus.
But this title is borne neither by any Greek manuscript,
the Coptic-Sahidian papyrus, nor the Latin manuscripts
with the exception of a few of the most recent.
It may be traced only subsequently to the twelfth century,
although at a very early period, in one of the two
prefaces attached to the work, Nicodemus is mentioned
in one place as a Hebrew author and in another as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Greek translator. But aside from the title, the handwriting
displays great variation, and the two prefaces
alluded to above show clearly the work of two hands.
Notwithstanding this, however, there are decisive
grounds for holding that our Acts of Pilate contains
in its main substance the document drawn from Justin
and Tertullian. The first of these to be noticed is, that
the Greek text, as given in the version most widely
circulated in the manuscripts, is surprisingly corroborated
by two documents of the rarest character, and
first used by myself&mdash;a Coptic-Sahidian papyrus manuscript
and a Latin palimpsest&mdash;both probably dating
from the fifth century. Such a documentary confirmation
of their text is possessed by scarcely ten works of
the collective Greek classic literature. Both of these
ancient writings make it in the highest degree probable
that the Egyptian and Latin translations which they
contain were executed still earlier.</p>

<p>"But could a work which was held in great consideration
in Justin's and Tertullian's time and down to
the commencement of the fourth century, and which
strenuously insists that the Emperor Maximin caused
other blasphemous Acts of Pilate to be published and
zealously circulated, manifestly for the purpose of displacing
and discrediting the older Christian Acts&mdash;could
such a work suddenly change its whole form,
and from the fifth century, to which in so extraordinary
a manner translators, wholly different in character,
point back with such wonderful concurrence, continue
in the new form? Contrary as this is to all historical
criticism, there is in the contents of the work, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
singular manner in which isolated and independent details
are shown to be related to the canonical books, no
less than in the accordance with the earliest quotations
found in Justin and Tertullian, a guaranty of the greatest
antiquity.</p>

<p>"There are in the contents, also, matters of such a
nature that we must confess that they are to be traced
back to the primitive edition, as, for example the narrative
in the first chapter of the bringing forward of
the accused.</p>

<p>"It is incorrect, moreover, to draw a conclusion from
Justin's designation of the Acta which is not warranted
by the whole character of the work. The Acta, the
<i><span lang="el" title="Greek: hypomnêmata">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span></i>, are specified in Justin's account not less
than in the manuscripts which we possess, as being
written <i>under</i> Pontius Pilate, and that can signify nothing
else than that they were an official production composed
under the direct sanction of the Roman governor.
Their transmission to the emperor must be imagined
as accompanied by a letter of the same character with
that which has been brought down to us in the Greek
and Latin edition, and yet not at all similar in purport
to the notable Acts of Pilate."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

and counted worthy of the holy baptism, searching

<p><span class="smcap">Chapter 1.</span>&mdash;Having called a council, the high
priests and the scribes Annas and Caiaphas and Semes
and Dathaes, and Gamaliel, Judas, Levi and Nepthalim,
Alexander and Jaïrus, and the rest of the Jews,
came to Pilate accusing Jesus about many things, saying:
We know this man to be the son of Joseph the
carpenter, born of Mary; and he says that he is the
Son of God, and a king; moreover, profanes the Sabbath,
and wishes to do away with the law of our fathers.
Pilate says: And what are the things which he
does, to show that he wishes to do away with it? The
Jews say: We have a law not to cure anyone on the
Sabbath; but this man has, on the Sabbath, cured the
lame and the crooked, the withered and the blind and
the paralytic, the dumb and the demoniac, by evil practices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Pilate says to them: What evil practices? They
say to him: He is a magician, and by Beelzebub, prince
of the demons, he casts out the demons, and all are
subject to him. Pilate says to them: This is not casting
out the demons by an unclean spirit, but by the
god Esculapius.</p>

<p>The Jews say to Pilate: We entreat your highness
that he stand at the tribunal and be heard. And Pilate,
having called them, says: Tell me how I, being
a procurator, can try a king? They say to him: We
do not say that he is a king, but he himself says that
he is. And Pilate, having called the runner, says to
him: Let Jesus be brought in with respect. And the
runner, going out and recognizing him, adored him,
and took his cloak into his hand and spread it on the
ground, and says to him: My Lord, walk on this and
come in, for the procurator calls thee. And the Jews,
seeing what the runner had done, cried out against
Pilate, saying: Why hast thou ordered him to come
in by a runner, and not by a crier? for assuredly the
runner, when he saw him, adored him, and spread
his doublet on the ground and made him walk like
a king.</p>

<p>And Pilate, having called the runner, says to him:
Why hast thou done this, and spread out thy cloak
upon the earth and made Jesus walk upon it? The
runner says to him: My Lord procurator, when thou
didst send me to Jerusalem to Alexander, I saw him
sitting upon an ass, and the sons of the Hebrews held
branches in their hands and shouted; and others spread
their clothes under him saying: Save now, thou who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
art in the highest; blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord.</p>

<p>The Jews cry out and say to the runner: The sons
of the Hebrews shouted in Hebrew; whence, then, hast
thou the Greek? The runner says to them: I asked
one of the Jews, and said: What is it they are shouting
in Hebrew? And he interpreted it for me. Pilate says
to them: And what did they shout in Hebrew? The
Jews say to him: <i>Hosanna membrome baruchamma
adonai.</i> Pilate says to them: And this hosanna, etc.,
how is it interpreted? The Jews say to him: Save now
in the highest; blessed is he that cometh in the name
of the Lord. Pilate says to them: If you bear witness
to the words spoken by the children, in what has the
runner done wrong? And they were silent. And the
procurator says to the runner: Go out and bring him
in what way thou wilt. And the runner, going out, did
in the same manner as before, and says to Jesus: My
Lord, come in; the procurator calleth thee.</p>

<p>And Jesus, going in, and the standard bearers holding
their standards, the tops of the standards bent down,
and adored Jesus. And the Jews, seeing the bearing
of the standards how they were bent down and adored
Jesus, cried out vehemently against the standard bearers.
And Pilate says to the Jews: Do you not wonder
how the tops of the standards were bent down and
adored Jesus? The Jews say to Pilate: We saw how
the standard bearers bent them down and adored him.
And the procurator, having called the standard bearers,
says to them: Why have you done this? They say to
Pilate: We are Greeks and temple slaves, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
could we adore him? and assuredly, as we were holding
them up, the tops bent down of their own accord and
adored him.</p>

<p>Pilate says to the rulers of the synagogue and the
elders of the people: Do you choose for yourselves men
strong and powerful, and let them hold up the standards,
and let us see whether they will bend down with
them. And the elders of the Jews picked out twelve
men powerful and strong, and made them hold up the
standards six by six; and they were placed in front of
the procurator's tribunal. And Pilate says to the runner:
Take him outside of the Pretorium, and bring him
in again in whatever way may please thee. And Jesus
and the runner went out of the Pretorium. And Pilate,
summoning those who had formerly held up the standards,
says to them: I have sworn by the health of
Cæsar, that if the standards do not bend down when
Jesus comes in, I will cut off your heads. And the
procurator ordered Jesus to come in the second time.
And the runner did in the same manner as before, and
made many entreaties to Jesus to walk on his cloak.
And he walked on it and went in. And as he went in
the standards were again bent down and adored Jesus.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 2.</span>&mdash;And Pilate, seeing this, was afraid, and
sought to go away from the tribunal, but when he was
still thinking of going away, his wife sent to him saying:
Have nothing to do with this just man, for many
things have I suffered on his account this night. And
Pilate, summoning the Jews, says to them: You know
that my wife is a worshiper of God, and prefers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
adhere to the Jewish religion along with you. They
say to him: Yes, we know. Pilate says to them: Behold,
my wife has sent to me, saying, Have nothing
to do with this just man, for many things have I suffered
on account of him this night. And the Jews answering,
say unto Pilate: Did we not tell thee that he
was a sorcerer? Behold, he has sent a dream to thy
wife.</p>

<p>And Pilate, having summoned Jesus, says to him:
What do these witness against thee? Sayest thou nothing?
And Jesus said: Unless they had the power, they
would say nothing; for every one has the power of
his own mouth to speak both good and evil. They
shall see to it.</p>

<p>And the elders of the Jews answered, and said to
Jesus: What shall we see? First, that thou wast
born of fornication; secondly, that thy birth in Bethlehem
was the cause of the murder of the infants;
thirdly, that thy father Joseph and thy mother Mary
fled into Egypt because they had no confidence in the
people.</p>

<p>Some of the bystanders, pious men of the Jews, say:
We deny that he was born of fornication; for we know
that Joseph espoused Mary, and he was not born of
fornication. Pilate says to the Jews who said he was
of fornication: This story of yours is not true, because
they were betrothed, as also these fellow-countrymen
of yours say. Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate: All
the multitude of us cry out that he was born of fornication,
and are not believed; these are proselytes and
his disciples. And Pilate, calling Annas and Caiaphas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
says to them: What are proselytes? They say to him:
They are by birth children of the Greeks, and have
now become Jews. And those that said that he was
not born of fornication, viz.: Lazarus, Asterius, Antonius,
James, Amnes, Zeras, Samuel, Isaac, Phinees,
Crispus, Agrippas and Judas, say: We are not proselytes,
but are children of the Jews, and speak the truth;
for we were present at the betrothal of Joseph and
Mary.</p>

<p>And Pilate, calling these twelve men who said that
he was not born of fornication, says to them: I adjure
you, by the health of Cæsar, to tell me whether it be
true that you say, that he was not born of fornication.
They say to Pilate: We have a law against taking oaths,
because it is a sin; but they will swear by the health
of Cæsar that it is not as we have said, and we are
liable to death. Pilate says to Annas and Caiaphas:
Have you nothing to answer to this? Annas and Caiaphas
say to Pilate: These twelve are believed when they
say that he was not born of fornication; all the multitude
of us cry out that he was born of fornication, and
that he is a sorcerer; and he says that he is the Son
of God and a king, and we are not believed.</p>

<p>And Pilate orders all the multitude to go out, except
the twelve men who said that he was not born
of fornication, and he ordered Jesus to be separated
from them. And Pilate says to them: For what reason
do they wish to put him to death? They say to him:
They are angry because he cures on the Sabbath. Pilate
says: For a good work do they wish to put him to
death? They say to him: Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span></p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 3.</span>&mdash;And Pilate, filled with rage, went outside
of the Pretorium and said to them: I take the sun to
witness that I find no fault in this man. The Jews
answered and said to the procurator: Unless this man
were an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him to
thee. And Pilate said: Do you take him and judge
him according to your law. The Jews said to Pilate:
It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death. Pilate
said: Has God said that you are not to put to death,
but that I am?</p>

<p>And Pilate went again into the Pretorium and spoke
to Jesus privately, and said to him: Art thou the king
of the Jews? Jesus answered Pilate: Dost thou say
this of thyself, or have others said it to thee of me?
Pilate answered Jesus: Am I also a Jew? Thy nation
and the chief priests have given thee up to me. What
hast thou done? Jesus answered: My kingdom is not
of this world; for if my kingdom were of this world,
my servants would fight in order that I should not be
given up to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from
thence. Pilate said to him: Art thou, then, a king?
Jesus answered him: Thou sayest that I am king. Because
for this have I been born, and I have come, in
order that everyone who is of the truth might hear my
voice. Pilate says to him: What is truth? Jesus says
to him: Truth is from heaven. Pilate says: Is truth
not upon earth? Jesus says to Pilate: Thou seest how
those who speak the truth are judged by those that have
the power upon earth.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 4.</span>&mdash;And leaving Jesus within the Pretorium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Pilate went out to the Jews and said to them: I find
no fault in him. The Jews say to him: He said, I can
destroy this temple, and in three days build it. Pilate
says: What temple? The Jews say: The one that Solomon
built in forty-six years, and this man speaks of
pulling it down and building it up in three days. Pilate
says to them: I am innocent of the blood of this
just man. See you to it. The Jews say: His blood be
upon us and upon our children.</p>

<p>And Pilate, having summoned the elders and priests
and Levites, said to them privately: Do not act thus,
because no charge that you bring against him is worthy
of death; for your charge is about curing and Sabbath
profanation. The elders and the priests and the Levites
say: If anyone speak evil against Cæsar, is he worthy
of death or not? Pilate says: He is worthy of death.
The Jews say to Pilate: If anyone speak evil against
Cæsar, he is worthy of death; but this man has spoken
evil against God.</p>

<p>And the procurator ordered the Jews to go outside
of the Pretorium; and, summoning Jesus, he says to
him: What shall I do to thee? Jesus says to Pilate:
As it has been given to thee. Pilate says: How given?
Jesus says: Moses and the prophets have proclaimed
beforehand of my death and resurrection. And the
Jews, noticing this and hearing it, say to Pilate: What
more wilt thou hear of this blasphemy? Pilate says
to the Jews: If these words be blasphemous, do you
take him for the blasphemy, and lead him away to
your synagogue and judge him according to your law.
The Jews say to Pilate: Our law bears that a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
wrongs his fellow-men is worthy to receive forty save
one: but he that blasphemeth God is to be stoned with
stones.</p>

<p>Pilate says to them: Do you take him and punish
him in whatever way you please. The Jews say to
Pilate: We wish that he be crucified. Pilate says: He
is not deserving of crucifixion.</p>

<p>And the procurator, looking round upon the crowds
of the Jews standing by, sees many of the Jews weeping,
and says: All the multitude do not wish him to
die. The elders of the Jews say: For this reason all
the multitude of us have come, that he should die.
Pilate says to the Jews: Why should he die? The Jews
say: Because he called himself the Son of God and
King.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 5.</span>&mdash;And one Nicodemus, a Jew, stood before
the procurator and said: I beseech your honor let me
say a few words. Pilate says: Say on. Nicodemus
says: I said to the elders and the priests and Levites,
and to all the multitude of the Jews in the synagogue,
What do you seek to do with this man? This man
does many miracles and strange things, which no one
has done or will do. Let him go and do not wish any
evil against him. If the miracles which he does are of
God, they will stand; but if of man, they will come
to nothing. For assuredly Moses, being sent by God
into Egypt, did many miracles, which the Lord commanded
him to do before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
And there were Jannes and Jambres, servants of Pharaoh,
and they also did not a few of the miracles which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Moses did; and the Egyptians took them to be gods&mdash;this
Jannes and Jambres. But, since the miracles which
they did were not of God, both they and those who
believed in them were destroyed. And now release
this man, for he is not deserving of death.</p>

<p>The Jews say to Nicodemus: Thou hast become his
disciple, and therefore thou defendest him. Nicodemus
says to them: Perhaps, too, the procurator has
become his disciple, because he defends him. Has the
emperor not appointed him to this place of dignity?
And the Jews were vehemently enraged, and gnashed
their teeth against Nicodemus. Pilate says to them:
Why do you gnash your teeth against him when you
hear the truth? The Jews say to Nicodemus: Mayst
thou receive his truth and his portion. Nicodemus
says: Amen, amen; may I receive it, as you have said.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 6.</span>&mdash;One of the Jews, stepping up, asked leave
of the procurator to say a word. The procurator says:
If thou wishest to say anything, say on. And the Jew
said: Thirty-eight years I lay in my bed in great agony.
And when Jesus came, many demoniacs and many lying
ill of various diseases were cured by him. And when
Jesus saw me he had compassion on me, and said to
me: Take up thy couch and walk. And I took up
my couch and walked. The Jews say to Pilate: Ask
him on what day it was when he was cured. He that
had been cured says: On a Sabbath. The Jews say:
Is not this the very thing we said, that on a Sabbath
he cures and casts out demons?</p>

<p>And another Jew stepped up and said: I was born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
blind; I heard sounds, but saw not a face. And as
Jesus passed by I cried out with a loud voice, Pity me,
O son of David. And he pitied me and put his hands
upon my eyes, and I instantly received my sight. And
another Jew stepped up and said: I was crooked and
he straightened me with a word. And another said:
I was a leper, and be cured me with a word.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 7.</span>&mdash;And a woman cried out from a distance
and said: I had an issue of blood, and I touched the
hem of his garment, and the issue of blood, which I
had had for twelve years, was stopped. The Jews say:
We have a law that a woman's evidence is not received.</p>

<hr class="l2" />
<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 8.</span>&mdash;And others, a multitude both of men and
women, cried out, saying: This man is a prophet, and
the demons are subject to him. Pilate says to them
who said that the demons were subject to him: Why,
then, were not your teachers also subject to him? They
say to Pilate: We do not know. And others said: He
raised Lazarus from the tomb after he had been dead
four days. And the procurator trembled, and said to
all the multitude of the Jews: Why do you wish to
pour out innocent blood?</p>

<hr class="l2" />
<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 9.</span>&mdash;And, having summoned Nicodemus and
the twelve men that said he was not born of fornication,
he says to them: What shall I do, because there is
an insurrection among the people? They say to him:
We know not; let them see to it. Again Pilate, having
summoned all the multitude of the Jews, says: You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
know that it is customary, at the feast of unleavened
bread, to release one prisoner to you. I have one condemned
prisoner in the prison, a murderer named Bar
Abbas, and this man standing in your presence, Jesus
in whom I find no fault. Which of them do you wish
me to release to you? And they cry out: Bar Abbas.
Pilate says: What, then, shall we do to Jesus, who is
called Christ? The Jews say: Let him be crucified.
And others said: Thou art no friend of Cæsar's if thou
release this man, because he called himself the Son
of God and King. You wish this man, then, to be a
king, and not Cæsar?</p>

<p>And Pilate, in a rage, says to the Jews: Always has
your nation been rebellious, and you always speak
against your benefactors. The Jews say: What benefactors?
He says to them: Your God led you out of
the land of Egypt from bitter slavery, and brought you
safe through the sea as through dry land, and in the
desert fed you with manna and gave you quails, and
quenched your thirst with water from a rock, and gave
you a law; and in all these things have you provoked
your God to anger, and sought a molten calf. And
you exasperated your God, and he sought to slay you.
And Moses prayed for you, and you were not put to
death. And now you charge me with hating the emperor.</p>

<p>And, rising up from the tribunal, he sought to go
out. And the Jews cry out and say: We know that
Cæsar is king, and not Jesus. For assuredly the magi
brought gifts to him as to a king. And when Herod
heard from the magi that a king had been born, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
sought to slay him, and his father, Joseph, knowing
this, took him and his mother, and they fled into Egypt.
And Herod, hearing of it, destroyed the children of
the Hebrews that had been born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>And when Pilate heard these words he was afraid;
and, ordering the crowd to keep silence, because they
were crying out, he says to them: So this is he whom
Herod sought? The Jews say: Yes, it is he. And,
taking water, Pilate washed his hands in the face of
the sun, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this
just man: see you to it. Again the Jews cry out: His
blood be upon us and upon our children.</p>

<p>Then Pilate ordered the curtain of the tribunal
where he was sitting to be drawn, and says to Jesus:
Thy nation has charged thee with being a king. On
this account, I sentence thee first to be scourged, according
to the enactment of venerable kings, and then
to be fastened on the cross in the garden where thou
was seized. And let Dysmas and Gestas, the two malefactors,
be crucified with thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 10.</span>&mdash;And Jesus went forth out of the Pretorium,
and the malefactors with him. And when they
came to the place they stripped him of his clothes and
girded him with a towel, and put a crown of thorns on
him round his head. And they crucified him; and at
the same time, also, they hung up the two malefactors
along with him. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do. And the soldiers parted
his clothes among them; and the people stood looking
at him. And the chief priests and the rulers with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
mocked him, saying: He saved others, let him save
himself. If he be the Son of God, let him come down
from the cross. And the soldiers made sport of him,
coming near and offering him vinegar mixed with
gall, and said: Thou art the king of the Jews; save
thyself.</p>

<p>And Pilate, after the sentence, ordered the charge
against him to be inscribed as a superscription in Greek
and Latin and Hebrew, according to what the Jews
had said: He is king of the Jews.</p>

<p>And one of the malefactors hanging up spoke to him,
saying: If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us. And
Dysmas answering reproved him, saying: Dost thou
not fear God, because thou art in the same condemnation?
And we, indeed, justly, for we receive the fit
punishment of our deeds; but this man has done no
evil. And he said to Jesus: Remember me, Lord, in
thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him: Amen, amen;
I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 11.</span>&mdash;And it was about the sixth hour, and
there was darkness over the earth until the ninth hour,
the sun being darkened; and the curtain of the temple
was split in the middle. And, crying out with a loud
voice, Jesus said: Father, <i>baddach ephkid ruel</i>, which
is, interpreted, Into thy hands I commit my spirit.
And, having said this, he gave up the ghost. And
the centurion, seeing what had happened, glorified
God and said: This was a just man. And all the
crowds that were present at this spectacle, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
saw what had happened, beat their breasts and went
away.</p>

<p>And the centurion reported what had happened to
the procurator. And when the procurator and his wife
heard it they were exceedingly grieved, and neither
ate nor drank that day. And Pilate sent for the Jews
and said to them: Have you seen what has happened?
And they say: There has been an eclipse of the sun
in the usual way.</p>

<p>And his acquaintances were standing at a distance,
and the women who came with him from Galilee, seeing
these things. And a man named Joseph, a councillor
from the city of Arimathea, who also waited for
the kingdom of God, went to Pilate and begged the
body of Jesus. And he took it down and wrapped it
in a clean linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out of
the rock, in which no one had ever lain.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 12.</span>&mdash;And the Jews, hearing that Joseph had
begged the body of Jesus, sought him, and the twelve
who said that Jesus was not born of fornication, and
Nicodemus and many others who had stepped up before
Pilate and declared his good works. And of all
these that were hid Nicodemus alone was seen by them,
because he was a ruler of the Jews. And Nicodemus
says to them: How have you come into the synagogue?
The Jews say to him: How hast thou come into the
synagogue? for thou art a confederate of his, and his
portion is with thee in the world to come. Nicodemus
says: Amen, amen. And likewise Joseph also stepped
out and said to them: Why are you angry against me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
because I begged the body of Jesus? Behold, I have
put him in my new tomb, wrapping him in clean linen;
and I have rolled a stone to the door of the tomb. And
you have acted not well against the just man, because
you have not repented of crucifying him, but also have
pierced him with a spear. And the Jews seized Joseph
and ordered him to be secured until the first day of
the week, and said to him: Know that the time does
not allow us to do anything against thee, because the
Sabbath is dawning: and know that thou shalt not be
deemed worthy of burial, but we shall give thy flesh
to the birds of the air. Joseph says to them: These are
the words of the arrogant Goliath, who reproached the
living God and holy David. For God has said by the
prophet, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith
the Lord. And now that he is uncircumcised in flesh,
but circumcised in heart, has taken water and washed
his hands in the face of the sun, saying, I am innocent
of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. And you
answered and said to Pilate: His blood be upon us and
upon our children. And now I am afraid, lest the
wrath of God come upon you and upon your children,
as you have said. And the Jews, hearing these words,
were embittered in their souls, and seized Joseph and
locked him into a room where there was no window;
and guards were stationed at the door, and they sealed
the door where Joseph was locked in.</p>

<p>And on the Sabbath the rulers of the synagogue and
the priests and the Levites made a decree that all should
be found in the synagogue on the first day of the week.
And, rising up early, all the multitude in the synagogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
consulted by what death they should slay him. And
when the Sanhedrin was sitting, they ordered him to
be brought with much indignity. And, having opened
the door, they found him not. And all the people
were surprised and struck with dismay, because they
found the seals unbroken, and because Caiaphas had
the key. And they no longer dared to lay hands upon
those who had spoken before Pilate in Jesus' behalf.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 13.</span>&mdash;And while they were still sitting in the
synagogue and wondering about Joseph, there came
some of the guard whom the Jews had begged of Pilate
to guard the tomb of Jesus, that his disciples might
not come and steal him. And they reported to the
rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and Levites,
what had happened: how there had been an earthquake;
and we saw an angel coming down from heaven,
and he rolled away the stone from the mouth of
the tomb and sat upon it; and he shone like snow and
like lightning. And we were very much afraid, and
lay like dead men; and we heard the voice of the angel,
saying to the women who remained beside the tomb,
Be not afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who was
crucified. He is not here. He has risen, as he said.
Come, see the place where the Lord lay; and go quickly
and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead,
and is in Galilee.</p>

<p>The Jews say: To what women did he speak? The
men of the guard say: We know not who they were.
The Jews say: At what time was this? The men of
the guard say: At midnight. The Jews say: And wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
did you not lay hold of them? The men of the
guard say: We were like dead men from fear, not
expecting to see the light of day, and how could we
lay hold of them? The Jews say: As the Lord liveth,
we do not believe you. The men of the guard say to
the Jews: You have seen so great miracles in the case
of this man, and have not believed; and how can you
believe us? And assuredly you have done well to swear
that the Lord liveth, for indeed he does live. Again
the men of the guard say: We have heard that you
have locked up the man that begged the body of Jesus,
and put a seal on the door; and that you have opened
it and not found him. Do you, then, give us the man
whom you were guarding, and we shall give you Jesus.
The Jews say: Joseph has gone away to his own city.
The men of the guard say to the Jews: And Jesus has
risen, as we heard from the angel, and is in Galilee.</p>

<p>And when the Jews heard these words they were
very much afraid, and said: We must take care lest
this story be heard, and all incline to Jesus. And the
Jews called a council, and paid down a considerable
money and gave it to the soldiers, saying: Say, while
he slept, his disciples came by night and stole him;
and if this come to the ears of the procurator we shall
persuade him and keep you out of trouble. And they
took it, and said as they had been instructed.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 14.</span>&mdash;And Phinees, a priest, and Adas, a
teacher, and Haggai, a Levite, came down from Galilee
to Jerusalem, and said to the rulers of the synagogue,
and the priests and the Levites: We saw Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
and his disciples sitting on the mountain called Mamilch;
and he said to his disciples, Go into all the
world, and preach to every creature: he that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth
not shall be condemned. And these signs shall attend
those who have believed: in my name they shall cast
out demons, speak new tongues, take up serpents; and
if they drink any deadly thing it shall by no means hurt
them, they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall
be well. And while Jesus was speaking to his disciples
we saw him taken up into heaven.</p>

<p>The elders and priests and Levites say: Give glory
to the God of Israel, and confess to him whether you
have heard and seen those things, of which you have
given us an account. And those who had given the
account said: As the Lord liveth, the God of our
fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we heard these
things, and saw him taken up into heaven. The elders
and the priests and the Levites say to them: Have you
come to give us this announcement, or to offer prayer
to God? And they say: To offer prayer to God. The
elders and the chief priests and the Levites say to them:
If you have come to offer prayer to God, why, then,
have you told these idle tales in the presence of all the
people? Says Phinees, the priest, and Adas, the teacher,
and Haggai, the Levite, to the rulers of the synagogues,
and the priests and the Levites: If what we
have said and seen be sinful, behold, we are before
you; do to us as seems good in your eyes. And they
took the law and made them swear upon it not to give
any more an account of these matters to anyone. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
they gave them to eat and drink and sent them out of
the city, having given them also money, and three men
with them; and they sent them away to Galilee.</p>

<p>And these men, having gone into Galilee, the chief
priests and the rulers of the synagogue, and the elders
came together in the synagogue and locked the door,
and lamented with great lamentation, saying: Is this a
miracle that has happened in Israel? And Annas and
Caiaphas said: Why are you so much moved? Why
do you weep? Do you not know that his disciples
have given a sum of gold to the guards of the tomb,
and have instructed them to say that an angel came
down and rolled away the stone from the door of the
tomb? And the priests and elders said: Be it that his
disciples have stolen his body; how is it that the life
has come into his body, and that he is going about in
Galilee? And they, being unable to give an answer
to these things, said, after great hesitation: It is not
lawful for us to believe the uncircumcised.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 15.</span>&mdash;And Nicodemus stood up, and stood before
the Sanhedrin, saying: You say well; you are not
ignorant, you people of the Lord, of these men that
come down from Galilee, that they fear God, and are
men of substance, haters of covetousness, men of peace;
and they have declared with an oath, we saw Jesus
upon the mountain Mamilch with his disciples, and
he taught what we heard from him, and we saw him
taken up into heaven. And no one asked them in what
form he went up. For assuredly, as the book of the
Holy Scriptures taught us, Helias also was taken up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
into heaven, and Elissæus cried out with a loud voice,
and Helias threw his sheepskin upon Elissæus, and
Elissæus threw his sheepskin upon the Jordan, and
crossed and came into Jericho. And the children of
the prophets met him and said, O Elissæus, where is
thy master Helias? And he said, He has been taken
up into heaven. And they said to Elissæus, Has not
a spirit seized him, and thrown him upon one of the
mountains? But let us take our servants with us and
seek him. And they persuaded Elissæus, and he went
away with them. And they sought him three days, and
did not find him; and they knew that he had been
taken up. And now listen to me, and let us send into
every district of Israel and see, lest, perchance, Christ
has been taken up by a spirit and thrown upon one
of the mountains. And this proposal pleased all. And
they sent into every district of Israel and sought Jesus,
and did not find him; but they found Joseph in Arimathea,
and no one dared to lay hands on him.</p>

<p>And they reported to the elders and the priests and
the Levites: We have gone round to every district of
Israel, and have not found Jesus; but Joseph we have
found in Arimathea. And hearing about Joseph they
were glad and gave glory to the God of Israel. And
the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the
Levites, having held a council as to the manner in
which they should meet with Joseph, took a piece of
paper and wrote to Joseph as follows:</p>

<p>Peace to thee! We know that we have sinned against
God, and against thee; and we have prayed to the God
of Israel that thou shouldst deign to come to thy fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
and to thy children, because we all have been grieved.
For, having opened the door, we did not find thee.
And we know that we have counseled evil counsel
against thee; but the Lord has defended thee, and the
Lord himself has scattered to the winds our counsel
against thee, O honorable father Joseph.</p>

<p>And they chose from all Israel seven men, friends
of Joseph, whom, also, Joseph himself was acquainted
with; and the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests
and the Levites say to them: Take notice; if, after receiving
our letter he read it, know that he will come
with you to us. But if he do not read it, know that
he is ill-disposed towards us. And, having saluted him
in peace, return to us. And having blest the men, they
dismissed them. And the men came to Joseph and did
reverence to him, and said to him: Peace to thee! And
he said: Peace to you and to all the people of Israel!
And they gave him the roll of the letter. And Joseph,
having received it, read the letter and rolled it up, and
blessed God and said: Blessed be the Lord God, who
has delivered Israel, that they should not shed innocent
blood, and blessed be the Lord, who sent out his
angel and covered me under his wings. And he set a
table for them: and they ate and drank and slept there.</p>

<p>And they rose up early and prayed. And Joseph
saddled his ass and set out with the men: and they
came to the holy city Jerusalem. And all the people
met Joseph and cried out: Peace to thee in thy coming
in! And be said to all the people: Peace to you! and
he kissed them. And the people prayed with Joseph,
and they were astonished at the sight of him. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Nicodemus received him into his house and made a
great feast, and called Annas and Caiaphas and the
elders and the priests and the Levites to his house.
And they rejoiced, eating and drinking with Joseph;
and, after singing hymns, each proceeded to his own
house. But Joseph remained in the house of Nicodemus.</p>

<p>And on the following day, which was the preparation,
the rulers of the synagogue and the priests and
the Levites went early to the house of Nicodemus;
and Nicodemus met them and said: Peace to you!
And they said: Peace to thee and to Joseph, and
to all thy house and to all the house of Joseph!
And he brought them into his house. And all the
Sanhedrin sat down, and Joseph sat down between
Annas and Caiaphas; and no one dared to say a word
to him. And Joseph said: Why have you called me?
And they signaled to Nicodemus to speak to Joseph.
And Nicodemus, opening his mouth, said to Joseph:
Father, thou knowest that the honorable teachers and
the priests and the Levites seek to learn a word from
thee. And Joseph said: Ask. And Annas and Caiaphas,
having taken the law, made Joseph swear, saying:
Give glory to the God of Israel, and give him confession;
for Achar, being made to swear by the prophet
Jesus, did not forswear himself, but declared unto him
all, and did not hide a word from him. Do thou also,
accordingly, not hide from us to the extent of a word.
And Joseph said: I shall not hide from you one word.
And they said to him: With grief were we grieved because
thou didst beg the body of Jesus and wrap it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
clean linen and lay it in a tomb. And on account of
this we secured thee in a room where there was no
window; and we put locks and seals upon the doors,
and guards kept watching where thou wast locked in.
And on the first day of the week we opened and found
thee not, and were grieved exceedingly; and astonishment
fell upon all the people of the Lord until yesterday.
And now relate to us what happened to thee.</p>

<p>And Joseph said: On the preparation, about the tenth
hour, you locked me up, and I remained all the Sabbath.
And at midnight, as I was standing and praying,
the room where you locked me in was hung up by the
four corners, and I saw a light like lightning into my
eyes. And I was afraid and fell to the ground. And
some one took me by the hand and removed me from
the place where I had fallen; and moisture of water
was poured from my head even to my feet, and a smell
of perfumes came about my nostrils. And he wiped
my face and kissed me, and said to me, Fear not, Joseph:
open thine eyes and see who it is that speaks to
thee. And, looking up, I saw Jesus. And I trembled
and thought it was a phantom; and I said the commandments,
and he said them with me. Even so you
are not ignorant that a phantom, if it meet anybody
and hear the commandments, takes to flight. And seeing
that he said them with me, I said to him, Rabbi
Helias. And he said to me, I am not Helias. And I
said to him, Who art thou, my lord? And he said to
me, I am Jesus, whose body thou didst beg from Pilate;
and thou didst clothe me with clean linen, and didst
put a napkin on my face, and didst lay me in thy new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
tomb, and didst roll a great stone to the door of the
tomb. And I said to him that was speaking to me,
Show me the place where I laid thee. And he carried
me away and showed me the place where I laid him;
and the linen cloth was lying in it, and the napkin for
his face. And I knew that it was Jesus. And he took
me by the hand and placed me, though the doors were
locked, in the middle of my house, and led me away
to my bed and said to me, Peace to thee! And he
kissed me and said to me, For forty days go not forth
out of thy house; for, behold, I go to my brethren in
Galilee.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. 16.</span>&mdash;And the rulers of the synagogue, and
the priests and the Levites when they heard these words
from Joseph, became as dead, and fell to the ground,
and fasted until the ninth hour. And Nicodemus, along
with Joseph, exhorted Annas and Caiaphas, the priests
and the Levites, saying: Rise up and stand upon your
feet, and taste bread and strengthen your souls, because
to-morrow is the Sabbath of the Lord. And they rose
up and prayed to God, and ate and drank, and departed
every man to his own house.</p>

<p>And on the Sabbath our teachers and the priests and
Levites sat questioning each other and saying: What
is this wrath that has come upon us? for we know his
father and mother. Levi, a teacher, says: I know that
his parents fear God, and do not withdraw themselves
from the prayers, and give the tithes thrice a year.
And when Jesus was born his parents brought him to
this place and gave sacrifices and burnt offerings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
God. And when the great teacher, Symeon, took him
into his arms, he said, Now thou sendest away thy servant,
Lord, according to thy word, in peace; for mine
eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared
before the face of all the peoples; a light for the revelation
of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
Israel. And Symeon blessed them, and said to Mary
his mother, I give thee good news about this child.
And Mary said, It is well, my lord. And Symeon said
to her, It is well; behold, he lies for the fall and the
rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken
against; and of thee thyself a sword shall go through
the soul, in order that the reasoning of many hearts may
be revealed.</p>

<p>They say to the teacher Levi: How knowest thou
these things? Levi says to them: Do you not know
that from him I learned the law? The Sanhedrin say
to him: We wish to see thy father. And they sent for
his father. And they asked him, and he said to them:
Why have you not believed my son? The blessed and
just Symeon himself taught him the law. The Sanhedrin
says to Rabbi Levi: Is the word that you have
said true? And he said: It is true. And the rulers of
the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites said to
themselves: Come, let us send into Galilee to the three
men that came and told about his teaching and his
taking up, and let them tell us how they saw him taken
up. And this saying pleased all. And they sent away
the three men who had already gone away into Galilee
with them; and they say to them: Say to Rabbi Adas
and Rabbi Phinees and Rabbi Haggai, Peace to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
and all who are with you! A great inquiry having
taken place in the Sanhedrin, we have been sent to
you to call you to this holy place, Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And the men set out into Galilee and found them
sitting and considering the law: and they saluted them
in peace. And the men who were in Galilee said to
those who had come to them: Peace unto all Israel!
And they said: Peace to you! And they again said
to them: Why have you come? And those who had
been sent said: The Sanhedrin call you to the holy city
Jerusalem. And when the men heard that they were
sought by the Sanhedrin they prayed to God, and reclined
with the men and ate and drank, and rose up
and set out in peace to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And on the following day the Sanhedrin sat in the
synagogue, and asked them, saying: Did you really see
Jesus sitting on the mountain Mamilch teaching his
eleven disciples, and did you see him taken up? And
the men answered them and said: As we saw him taken
up, so also we said.</p>

<p>Annas says: Take them away from one another and
let us see whether their account agrees. And they took
them away from one another. And first they call Adas
and say to him: How didst thou see Jesus taken up?
Adas says: While he was yet sitting on the mountain
Mamilch and teaching his disciples, we saw a cloud
overshadowing both him and his disciples. And the
cloud took him up into heaven, and his disciples lay
upon their faces upon the earth. And they call Phinees,
the priest, and ask him also, saying: How didst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>thou see Jesus taken up? And he spoke in like manner.
And they again asked Haggai, and he spoke in like
manner. And the Sanhedrin said: The law of Moses
holds: At the mouth of two or three every word shall
be established. Buthem, a teacher, says: It is written
in the law, And Enoch walked with God, and is not,
because God took him. Jaïrus, a teacher, said: And
the death of holy Moses we have heard of, and have
not seen it; for it is written in the law of the Lord, and
Moses died from the mouth of the Lord, and no man
knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. And Rabbi
Levi said: Why did Rabbi Symeon say, when he saw
Jesus, "Behold, he lies for the fall and rising again
of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against"?
And Rabbi Isaac said: It is written in the law, Behold,
I send my messenger before thy face, who shall go
before thee to keep thee in every good way, because
my name has been called upon him.</p>

<p>Then Annas and Caiaphas said: Rightly have you
said what is written in the law of Moses, that no one
saw the death of Enoch, and no one has named the
death of Moses; but Jesus was tried before Pilate,
and we saw him receiving blows and spittings on his
face, and the soldiers put about him a crown of thorns,
and he was scourged and received sentence from Pilate,
and was crucified upon the Cranium, and two robbers
with him; and they gave him to drink vinegar
with gall, and Longinus, the soldier, pierced his side
with a spear; and Joseph, our honorable father, begged
his body, and he says he is risen; and as the three teachers
say, We saw him taken up into heaven; and Rabbi
Levi has given evidence of what was said by Rabbi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Symeon, and that he said, Behold, he lies for the fall
and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign
spoken against. And all the teachers said to all the
people of the Lord: If this was from the Lord, and
is wonderful in your eyes, knowing you shall know,
O house of Jacob, that it is written, Cursed is every
one that hangeth upon a tree. And another scripture
teaches: The gods which have not made the heaven
and the earth shall be destroyed. And the priests and
the Levites said to each other: If this memorial be
until the year that is called Jobel, know that it shall
endure forever, and he hath raised for himself a new
people. Then the rulers of the synagogue, and the
priests and the Levites, announced to all Israel, saying:
Cursed is that man who shall worship the work of
man's hand, and cursed is the man who shall worship
the creatures more than the Creator. And all the people
said, Amen, amen.</p>

<p>And all the people praised the Lord, and said:
Blessed is the Lord, who hath given rest to his people
Israel, according to all that he hath spoken; there hath
not fallen one word of every good word of his that
he spoke to Moses, his servant. May the Lord our
God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him
not destroy us. And let him not destroy us, that we
may incline our hearts to him, that we may walk in
all his ways, that we may keep his commandments and
his judgments which he commanded to our fathers.
And the Lord shall be for a king over all the earth
in that day; and there shall be one Lord, and his name
one. The Lord is our king; he shall save us. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
is none like thee, O Lord. Great art thou, O Lord,
and great is thy name. By thy power heal us, O Lord,
and we shall be healed; save us, O Lord, and we shall
be saved, because we are thy lot and heritage. And
the Lord will not leave his people, for his great name's
sake; for the Lord has begun to make us into his
people.</p>

<p>And all, having sung praises, went away each man
to his own house glorifying God; for his is the glory
forever and ever. Amen.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
